# Open Sesame

This repository contains the code for the paper [Open Sesame: Getting Inside BERT's Linguistic Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01698).

## Credits

We built the project on top of some awesome open-source repos:
- HuggingFace's [pytorch-pretrained-BERT](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT)
- Jesse Vig's [bertviz](https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz)

We would also like to thank Prof. Robert Frank and the members of the [Computational Linguisics at Yale](http://clay.yale.edu/) lab for their guidance and support :)
