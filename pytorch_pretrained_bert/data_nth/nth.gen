the bill intends to restrict the rt ##c to treasury borrowing ##s only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .
the complex financing plan in the s & l bail ##out law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created rt ##c .
this financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bail ##out spending from swelling the budget deficit .
another $ 20 billion would be raised through treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates .
` ` it ' s a problem that clearly has to be resolved , ' ' said david cooke , executive director of the rt ##c .
` ` we would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , ' ' he said .
the complicated language in the huge new law has mud ##die ##d the fight .
the law does allow the rt ##c to borrow from the treasury up to $ 5 billion at any time .
` ` the rt ##c is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the hill if they want that kind of flexibility . ' '
the ways and means committee will hold a hearing on the bill next tuesday .
we ' re about to see if advertising works .
their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market , as individual investors did in drove ##s after the crash in october
just days after the 1987 crash , major broker ##age firms rushed out ads to calm investors .
this time around , they ' re moving even faster .
pain ##ew ##eb ##ber inc . filmed a new television commercial at 4 p . m . ed ##t yesterday and had it on the air by last night .
fidelity investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today .
shear ##son lehman hutton inc . by yesterday afternoon had already written new tv ads .
it considered running them during tomorrow night ' s world series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday .
other broker ##age firms , including merrill lynch & co . , were plotting out potential new ad strategies .
the broker ##age firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .
fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge .
when the market went into its free fall friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the monday editions of half a dozen newspapers .
the ads to ##uted fidelity ' s automated 800 - number beneath the huge headline , ` ` fidelity is ready for your call . ' '
` ` a lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , ' ' he says .
` ` to maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .
it would have been too late to think about on friday .
we had to think about it ahead of time . ' '
today ' s fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with fidelity .
it goes on to plug a few diversified fidelity funds by name .
pain ##ew ##eb ##ber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash .
it also negotiated an arrangement with cable news network under which cnn would agree to air its last - minute creations .
we continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long - term appreciation . ' '
the spot was scheduled to appear three times on cnn last night .
pain ##ew ##eb ##ber considered an even harder sell , recommend ##ing specific stocks .
instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its life ##line to keep that money in the market .
` ` if you owned it and liked it friday , the true value has n ' t changed . ' '
he adds , ` ` this is n ' t 1987 revisited . ' '
with the market flu ##ct ##uating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly rev ##ise their approach .
at shear ##son lehman , executives created potential new commercials friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to reg ##roup yesterday afternoon .
but in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , shear ##son executives decided not to go ahead with the stock - market ad .
` ` we do n ' t think at this point anything needs to be said .
in any case , the broker ##age firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 .
but it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .
in 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en mass ##e .
now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .
mr . es ##kan ##dar ##ian , who resigned his della fe ##mina post in september , becomes chairman and chief executive of arnold .
john ve ##rret , the agency ' s president and chief executive , will retain the title of president .
that account had been handled by della fe ##mina , mc ##name ##e wc ##rs .
the magazine will distribute 10 % of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers .
you know what the law of averages is , do n ' t you ?
more ##ver , much of the damage was accomplished by a ' s who had some catching up to do .
` ` if you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , ' ' he later remarked .
right - hand ##er dave stewart held the giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the saturday ledger .
` ` every guy they put out there had a better split - finger than the guy before , ' ' marvel ##ed giant manager roger craig .
that ' s not an average to soothe giant root ##ers .
a few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblem ##s of both teams .
` ` i ' m for the giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .
the above represents a triumph of either ap ##athy or civil ##ity .
anyway , the a ' s gave you a lot of heroes to root for .
not his auto ##graph ; power - hitter mc ##g ##wire ' s .
` ` when you ' re in the groove , you see every ball tremendous ##ly , ' ' he lectured .
the cold guys in the set were will clark , kevin mitchell and matt williams , the giants ' 3 - 4 - 5 hitter ##s .
they combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the cubs .
they went a collective 5 - for - 24 here , with zero homer ##s and rib ##bies .
it ' s that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the giants hope in the series games to come .
` ` i believe in the law of averages , ' ' declared san francisco batting coach dusty baker after game two .
but the old dodge ##r slug ##ger wise ##ly offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side .
` ` when it goes , you never know when you ' ll get it back , ' ' he said .
nc ##r corp . reported a 10 % drop in third - quarter net income , citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip .
net income for the quarter fell to $ 93 . 1 million from $ 103 . 1 million , roughly what analysts had expected .
average shares outstanding dropped to 75 . 8 million from 82 . 1 million .
revenue fell 1 % to $ 1 . 39 billion from $ 1 . 41 billion .
nc ##r said revenue declined both in the u . s . and overseas , reflecting a world - wide soft ##ening of the computer markets .
the company , however , said orders in the u . s . showed ` ` good gains ' ' during the latest quarter .
these factors , combined with a strong dollar , should negatively affect the current quarter ' s results , nc ##r said .
mr . hi ##ngo ##rani said he lowered his full - year estimates for 1989 to $ 5 . 35 a share from $ 5 . 50 a share .
revenue projections were slashed to $ 6 . 03 billion from $ 6 . 20 billion .
revenues declined 1 % to $ 4 . 17 billion from $ 4 . 19 billion .
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , nc ##r shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 57 .
that should stop a lot of account - churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .
now , would n ' t that be a novelty .
` ` i had calls all night long from the states , ' ' he said .
` ` i was woken up every hour - - 1 : 30 , 2 : 30 , 3 : 30 , 4 : 30 .
people are looking for possible opportunities to buy , but nobody wants to stick their chin out . ' '
for many of london ' s securities traders , it was a day that started nervously in the small hours .
by lunch ##time , the selling was at near - panic fever .
but as the day ended in a frantic wall street - inspired rally , the city breathed a sigh of relief .
so it went yesterday in the trading rooms of london ' s financial district .
in the wake of wall street ' s plunge last friday , the london market was considered especially vulnerable .
and before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be .
by the time trading officially got under way at 9 a . m . , the news from asia was in .
red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks .
the jeff ##eries office , a branch of the los angeles - based firm , played it conservative ##ly , seeking to avoid risk .
` ` we tend to run a very tight book . ' '
jeff ##eries spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n ' t many buyers .
seconds later , a 7 , 500 - share ` ` sell ' ' order for scottish & newcastle came in .
for the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to mr . smith left the no - smoking area to have a cigarette .
on the screens , only two for ##lor ##n blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 .
` ` because tokyo did n ' t collapse , let ' s pick up a little stock , ' ' mr . smith said .
he targeted 7 , 500 shares of reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes .
but the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pen ##ce .
` ` when i want to buy , they run from you - - they keep changing their prices , ' ' mr . smith said .
` ` it ' s very frustrating . ' '
he temporarily abandoned his search for the reuters shares .
we ' re in for a lot of turbulence . . . . ' '
by midday , the london market was in full retreat .
` ` it ' s falling like a stone , ' ' said danny linger , a pit trader who was standing outside the london international financial futures exchange .
only half the usual lunch ##time crowd gathered at the tony corn ##ey & barrow wine bar on old broad street nearby .
conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television .
at 12 : 49 p . m . , the index hit its low , 202 ##9 . 7 , off 204 . 2 points .
` ` spain is down 10 % and suspended , sweden ' s down 8 % , norway 11 % .
this market has been very badly damaged . ' '
they saw an opportunity created by the sell - off .
investors here still expect ford motor co . or general motors corp . to bid for jaguar .
suddenly , after about 45 minutes , the u . s . markets rallied .
as wall street strengthened , the london trading room went wild .
traders shouted as their screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on wall street .
then , nine minutes later , wall street suddenly rebound ##ed to a gain on the day .
` ` rally ! rally ! rally ! ' ' shouted shear ##son trader andy rosen , selling more jaguar shares .
as the london market rallied , some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and ji ##tters had been worth it .
the london index closed at 216 ##3 . 4 , its high for the day , off 70 . 5 , or about 3 . 3 % .
do n ' t be such a pe ##ssi ##mist , mr . ambassador .
the bill is expected to be taken up by the public works and transportation committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged .
elaine chao , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration ' s opposition to the bill ` ` in its present form . ' '
rep . obe ##rst ##ar brushed off mr . trump ' s allegations as an ` ` excuse for his own deal failing . ' '
mr . obe ##rst ##ar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n ' t a response to any particular market situation .
but they cited the ua ##l and am ##r examples as reasons to move quickly to en ##act this legislation .
` ` it ' s still on the fast track and we still want to do it , ' ' said one senate aide .
the bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leverage ##d buy - out .
it also would require the acquiring party to not ##ify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .
if more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days .
` ` we ' re encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , ' ' a boeing spokesman said .
currently , average pay for mach ##ini ##sts is $ 13 . 39 an hour , boeing said .
now in its 13th day , the strike has idle ##d about 55 , 000 mach ##ini ##sts and has started to delay delivery of some jet ##liner ##s .
with a strike fund of about $ 100 million , the union had said it was prepared for a long strike .
after the third week on strike , union members will begin receiving $ 100 a week from the fund .
work at boeing continues with supervisors and other non - striking personnel manning the lines .
under kansas right - to - work laws , contracts can not require workers to be union members .
boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant rent ##on , wash . , plant .
union officials could n ' t be reached for comment .
a d ##pc spokesman declined to elaborate on the group ' s new plan .
in american stock exchange composite trading yesterday , data ##pro ##du ##cts shares jumped 62 . 5 cents to close at $ 9 . 375 .
data ##pro ##du ##cts , which had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in september and took itself off the auction block .
the company ' s restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its new england subsidiary .
he called today ' s announcement ` ` op ##port ##uni ##stic and disrupt ##ive ' ' and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring .
european investors have further reason for optimism today , after the u . s . rebound .
west german economics minister helmut ha ##uss ##mann said , ` ` in my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly .
there may be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they are n ' t based on fundamental ##s .
the economy of west germany and the ec - lc ##b - european community - rc ##b - is highly stable . ' '
paris , which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks , also was hard hit .
share prices fell in milan , amsterdam , zurich , madrid and stockholm .
prices in brussels , where a computer breakdown disrupted trading , also tumbled .
one of the sharpe ##st declines came in the financial center of europe ' s strongest economy .
the dax index of 30 west german blue chips plunged 12 . 8 % , a one - day record , wiping out the summer ' s gains .
the index closed at 138 ##5 . 72 , down 203 . 56 points .
by comparison , two years ago on black monday , the new index would have dropped 9 . 4 % , according to a projection by the exchange .
this time , however , many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly .
` ` they all went in the wrong direction , ' ' said andreas ins ##am , an investment adviser for the bank in liechtenstein ' s frankfurt branch .
he said he told clients to buy selected west german blue chips after they fell by about 10 % .
` ` the beginning was chaotic , ' ' said nigel long ##ley , a broker for com ##mer ##z ##bank ag .
` ` it took three - quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market . ' '
` ` everybody was still confident , including most institutional investors .
some of west germany ' s blues ##t chips took some of the biggest hits .
it was big institutions such as norwich union insurance group , scottish ami ##cable investment managers and standard life assurance co . that spearheaded the rally .
attracted by low prices and encouraged by new york ' s performance , they scooped up e ##qui ##ties across the board .
volume was 95 ##9 . 3 million shares , more than triple recent levels .
late buying gave the paris bo ##urse a parachute after its free fall early in the day .
the ca ##c general index ended down 5 . 4 % at 52 ##3 . 6 , a drop of 29 . 6 points from friday .
` ` when wall street turned around shortly after the opening , there was panic buying in paris . ' '
trading was driven primarily by small investors and spec ##ulator ##s , with large institutions waiting on the side ##lines until late in the day .
when wall street turned , however , the big boys entered the market , looking for bargain ##s .
the latest quarter ' s loss equals $ 9 . 92 a share .
in the year - earlier quarter , morgan earned $ 233 . 6 million , or $ 1 . 25 a share .
george m . salem , analyst at pr ##ude ##ntial - bach ##e securities inc . , called the results ` ` mildly disappointing . ' '
excluding the $ 2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes morgan paid , earnings were about 65 cents a share , mr . salem said .
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , morgan climbed $ 1 . 50 a share to $ 44 . 125 .
net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ 254 million from $ 34 ##7 million .
such loans to argentina also remain classified as non - acc ##ru ##ing , costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period .
` ` these increases were partly offset by lower trading - related ' ' income , the bank said .
non - interest expenses grew 16 % to $ 49 ##6 million .
nc ##nb corp . ' s net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank ' s texas operations .
the strong performance , however , contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of nc ##nb ' s problem loans , particularly in the southeast .
non ##per ##form ##ers totaled $ 230 . 8 million , or 1 . 27 % in the year - ago third quarter .
in big board composite trading yesterday , nc ##nb jumped $ 3 . 50 a share , to $ 51 .
nc ##nb said its third - quarter results reflect 100 % of earnings of the texas operation since aug . 1 .
these high - yielding loans in effect replaced some low - yielding assets such as inter - bank loans , which were allowed to decrease .
security pacific shares closed at $ 44 . 625 , down 37 . 5 cents , in big board composite trading .
the earnings represent a 0 . 89 % return on assets for security pacific , and an 18 . 9 % return on equity .
the loan growth offset continuing real - estate loan losses in the depressed arizona market .
non ##per ##form ##ing loans grew slightly to $ 1 . 75 billion at sept . 30 , from $ 1 . 7 billion a year ago .
non - interest income fell 6 % in the quarter , mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of hong kong banking operations .
non - interest expense grew only 4 % in the period .
the new offer , which seeks 50 . 3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 a share for 22 million lin shares .

mcc ##aw has ` ` no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , ' ' the lin board said .
in national over - the - counter trading , lin closed at $ 104 . 75 , down $ 2 . 75 .

mrs . hills said the u . s . and canada have until nov . 13 to resolve the dispute .
the u . s . trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the canadian export restrictions .
canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in british columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export .
this action was defended by the canadian government on conservation grounds .
mrs . hills said yesterday that the dispute - settlement panel rejected this canadian government argument .
she said the canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded .

what happened friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another melt ##down in prices .
no fi ##ddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling .
but markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency .
after the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose .
it is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic .
a temporary ce ##ssa ##tion of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself .
but there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will int ##ens ##ify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .
what happened friday was the worst of all worlds .
the new york stock exchange , under its own rules , remained open .
with nowhere else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the new york stock exchange .
as liquid ##ity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply .
had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquid ##ity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense .
at 3 : 30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and washington , the futures exchanges reopened .
at this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the new york stock exchange .
traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them .
it therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .
to achieve maximum liquid ##ity and minimize price vol ##ati ##lity , either all markets should be open to trading or none .
synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on friday , but they probably would have made for smooth ##er , less volatile executions .
it ' s time for the exchanges and the securities and exchange commission to agree on joint conditions for halt ##ing trading or staying open .
the need for hurried last - minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that sync ##hr ##oni ##ze circuit breakers in all markets .
the rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies .
in many ways , our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago .
the new york stock exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day .
- l ##rb - of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices .

reluctant ad ##vert ##iser ##s try soft - sell spots
pittsburgh consultant david bear is selling a soft approach to clients who want exposure yet shu ##n push ##y ads .
his pl ##oy : 60 - second radio spots that offer helpful hints .
the only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot .
the messages resemble the business traveler , a daily dose of travel tips developed by mr . bear and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities .
new un - ad ##vert ##iser ##s include burt hill ko ##sar ri ##ttle ##mann associates , a butler , pa . , architectural firm .
its radio series features such spots as ` ` flood ##lights : evening wear for urban structures ' ' and ` ` building a place to park . ' '
a harder sell , says john ko ##sar , the firm ' s president , would ` ` det ##rac ##t from the profession . ' '

the continuing series of hu ##d scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork - barrel politics .
there ' s nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending .
but the nah ##b was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production .
through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer ' s coalition , pushing for such initiatives as the balanced - budget amendment .
yet on matters close to , er , home . . .
` ` the hu ##d budget has dropped by more than 70 % since 1980 , ' ' argues mr . colton .
` ` we ' ve taken more than our fair share .
i would n ' t have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . ' '
but nah ##b support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over the years the nah ##b has backed a host of public programs .
it once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti - recession housing measures .
moreover , explains one hu ##d official , the nah ##b remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that special ##ize in sub ##si ##di ##zed production .
the association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish - list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually .
indirect subsidies , through the f ##ha , for instance , are little better .
more important , housing programs run by hu ##d , the va , and fm ##ha are aw ##ash in red ink .
all told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion of mortgage ##s .
the association , a majority of whose 156 , 000 members build fewer than 25 units a year , is like many other business lo ##bbies .
explains sheila macdonald of the national taxpayers union : ` ` it tread ##s in two worlds .
unfortunately , the organization ' s desire for pork tends to over ##ride its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility .
as mr . colton of the nah ##b acknowledges : ` ` government is not going to solve the problem . . . .
the real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . ' '

in the first 25 minutes of tuesday ' s trading the nik ##kei index soared 66 ##4 . 83 points , to 351 ##33 . 83 .
monday ' s slide came in a relatively calm session that did n ' t provide much direction for other markets .

` ` we would like to wait and see until trading goes around through europe and new york . ' '
but in the absence of panic ##ky trading , its presence was never over ##tly felt .
the broader tokyo stock price index sank 45 . 66 , or 1 . 7 % , to 260 ##0 . 88 .
the day ' s decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions .
declining issues swamp ##ed advance ##rs , 94 ##1 - 105 .
but volume was thin at 52 ##6 . 2 million shares , compared with 57 ##4 . 7 million friday .
the market opened sharply lower , with the nik ##kei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes .
the smaller stocks in the tokyo market ' s second section also posted their biggest decline of the year .
the tokyo stock exchange index for the second section fell 100 . 96 , or 2 . 7 % , to 365 ##5 . 40 .
many investors , trying to out ##per ##form the market ' s major index ##es , have flock ##ed to these small issues in recent weeks .
japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the tokyo market did n ' t fall more sharply .
but its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago , during the october 1987 global stock market crash .
this time , wall street ' s plunge of 6 . 9 % friday was followed by yesterday ' s 1 . 8 % loss in tokyo .
thus , market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to wall street ' s opening .
` ` now we are looking for the time to place buy orders , ' ' he said .
` ` for us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . ' '
isa ##o us ##hi ##ku ##bo , general manager of the investment research department at toy ##o trust & banking co . , also was optimistic .
he described friday ' s plunge in the u . s . as a ` ` fleeting ' ' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .

major index ##es declined more than 8 % in australia and new zealand and 6 . 5 % in hong kong .
bangkok , manila , seoul , taipei and jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses .

similarly , kuala lumpur ' s composite index yesterday ended 27 . 5 % above its 1988 close .
in hong kong , the hang sen ##g index fell 180 . 60 to finish at 260 ##1 . 70 .
trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with 47 ##3 . 9 million friday .
but the session was orderly , in contrast to the market ' s four - day closure after the 1987 crash .
but volume rose only to 162 million shares from 143 million friday .
at its low , shortly before wall street opened , it was off more than 130 points .

in other words , california is pre ##sum ##ing to take control of the nation ' s farm policy .
as usual the green lobby ' s proposal is disconnected from scientific reality .
the proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % .
but if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?
the first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit .
the key here is the ambition of state attorney general john van de kam ##p .
that ' s also the day of the gubernatorial election .
the initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy hollywood weep ##ers who donate money .
and it allows mr . van de kam ##p to get around campaign spending limits .
this initiative is being labeled the big green , but maybe it should be called the big green ##back .
this is the state that recently passed the prop . 65 anti - toxic initiative .
if this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly .
the initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n ' t like .
that means the nr ##dc and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .
of course the state ' s liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves .

but to traders , it looked like disaster on the 9 : 30 a . m . opening bell .
the dow jones industrial average opened down 1 . 64 shortly after 9 : 30 .
the dow dropped to a quick 27 - point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .
then , to make matters worse , computer ##ized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steep ##er losses .
this was a hang ##over from friday , when standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks .
the onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized .
the dow accelerated its slide , losing 63 . 52 in the first 40 minutes of trading .
with program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall .
then at 10 : 15 the dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early - morning fall .
and this time , it was n ' t just the program traders who were responsible .
all the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .
the program traders were in there , too , of course .
` ` with the market down like this , we ' ll probably take another $ 50 million and put it in ' ' the market .
trading in walt disney co . particularly caught traders ' eyes .
the stock opened late at 114 1 \ / 2 , down 8 1 \ / 2 .
but then it shot upward 7 1 \ / 2 as goldman , sachs & co . stepped in and bought , traders said .
however , disney specialist robert fa ##gens ##on said : ` ` i would be surprised if goldman represented 4 % of the opening volume . ' '
around wall street , trading desk ##s were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to friday ' s grid ##lock .
at donaldson , lu ##fk ##in & jen ##ret ##te inc . , head equity trader dudley ep ##pel said : ` ` i think the opening was constructive .
there was n ' t a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally . . . .
not like friday where they just took - lc ##b - the market - rc ##b - apart . ' '
still , the market had n ' t yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were g ##lum .
on the big board floor and on trading desk ##s , traders ye ##lp ##ed their approval .
around him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of per ##rier water to cool them off .
among big board specialists , the cry was ` ` pull your offers ' ' - - meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares .
` ` it was bed ##lam on the upside , ' ' said one big board specialist .
over the weekend , clearing firms told the chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost monday morning .

then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a vengeance . ' '
however , according to one analyst , the timing of major market index futures buying just before the turn ##around was similar to that of terrible tuesday .

` ` the institutions ca n ' t be criticized for their behavior , ' ' mr . da ##pu ##zzo said in an interview .
` ` it was the opposite of what happened on oct . 19 .

in a sharply weaker london market yesterday , waterford shares were down 15 pen ##ce at 50 pen ##ce - l ##rb - 79 cents - rr ##b - .

the set ##back , in which treasury bond prices plum ##met ##ed , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit - taking .
` ` friday ' s flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs , ' ' he said .
some fixed - income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200 - point drop in the dow jones industrial average on friday .
that caused investors to flee stocks and buy high - quality treasury bonds , which are safer than other types of securities .
but when stocks began to climb instead , prices of treasury bonds declined .
among the firms were merrill lynch & co . and dean wit ##ter reynolds inc .
the rate is considered an early signal of changes in fed policy .
traders said yesterday ' s modest easing did n ' t stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected .
in fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week .

the reversal was even more evident among shorter - term treasury securities .
after treasury bill rates plum ##met ##ed as much as 0 . 70 percentage point on friday , they gave back three - fourth ##s of that amount yesterday .
investment - grade corporate bonds , mortgage - backed securities and municipal bonds also fell .
but prices of junk bonds , which were battered friday in near stands ##till trading , rebound ##ed to post small gains after a volatile trading session .
junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firm ##ed .

after years of fading into the background , two - tone photography is coming back .
trend ##y magazine advertisements feature stark black - and - white photos of hollywood celebrities pitching jeans , shoes and liquor .
portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black - and - white portrait orders .
and black - and - white photography classes are crowded with students .
what ' s happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography .
on seventh avenue , designers have been advancing the mono ##chrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white .
until two years ago , sales of black - and - white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s .
photographic companies are scrambling to tap the res ##urg ##ing market , rev ##iving some black - and - white product lines and developing new ones .
the rochester , n . y . , photographic giant recently began marketing t - max 320 ##0 , one of the fastest and most sensitive mono ##chrome films .
aimed at commercial photographers , the film can be used in very low light without sac ##ri ##fi ##cing quality , says donald franz of photo ##fin ##ishing newsletter .
also trying to s ##nare a portion of the $ 2 billion - a - year industry is ag ##fa corp . , a unit of bayer ag .
` ` we hope the trend lasts , ' ' says laurie di ##car ##a , il ##ford ' s marketing communications director .
for baby boom ##ers who grew up being photographed in color , black and white seems eye - catching and exotic .
` ` you can shift out of reality with black and white , ' ' he adds .
such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising .
processing of black - and - white commercial film jumped 24 % last year to 18 . 7 million rolls .
the campaign won a cl ##eo award as this year ' s best ad by a specialty retailer .
even food products and automobiles , which have long depended on color , are making the switch .
other companies that are currently using two - tone ads include american express co . and eps ##on america inc .
portrait studios have also latch ##ed onto the trend .
using black and white , ` ` we can make house ##wives look like stars , ' ' says john perrin .
his on - broadway photography studio in portland , ore . , doubled its business last year and , he says , is booked solid for the next five .
one customer , day ##na br ##un ##sd ##on , says she spur ##ned a color portrait for black and white because ` ` it ' s more dramatic .
i show it to my friends , and they all say ` wow . '
it is n ' t ordinary like color . ' '
still , most consumers are n ' t pl ##unk ##ing black - and - white film into their cameras to take family snaps ##hot ##s .
one big obstacle is that few drugs ##tore ##s develop the film anymore .
typically , it must be mail ##ed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned .
black - and - white film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same .
but for photo ##fin ##ish ##ers , developing costs for black - and - white film are higher .
il ##ford , for example , recently introduced a black - and - white film that can be processed quickly by color labs .
intent on woo ##ing customers , the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black - and - white photography classes .
similarly , ag ##fa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges , offering free black - and - white film and paper as prizes .
and ko ##dak is distributing an instructional video to processors on how to develop its mono ##chrome film more efficiently .
` ` it seems computers as ho ##bbies have wan ##ed , ' ' says ian bright ##man , be ##sel ##er ' s chairman and chief executive officer .
but some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fa ##d .
they cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and me ##asurable improvements in the quality of color prints .
` ` the color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago .
you ca n ' t say the same with black and white . ' '
` ` it ' s got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally , ' ' says alfred de ##bat of professional photographers of america .
sales rose more than 7 % to $ 94 . 9 million from $ 88 . 3 million .
the sacramento , cal ##if . , company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income .
sales grew almost 7 % to $ 279 . 1 million from $ 261 . 3 million .
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , the company closed at $ 25 . 25 a share , down 25 cents .
those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies .
the spokesman further said that at least two more offers are expected from other companies within two weeks .
the latest reading of 223 . 0 was up from 222 . 3 in july and 215 . 3 as recently as march .

commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge friday .

later , however , it became more of an under ##cu ##rre ##nt than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors .
copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy .

yesterday ' s october gain of $ 4 was mini ##scu ##le compared with that .
` ` what the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , ' ' said mr . card ##illo .

he expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising .
this would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold , he said .
the u . s . bench ##mark crude , west texas intermediate , closed at $ 20 . 59 a barrel for november delivery , down 30 cents .
some analysts said crude was due for a correction any ##how , following several days of significant gains .
but most market observers agreed that friday ' s stock market drop is what damp ##ened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday .
until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong .
the organization of petroleum export ##ing countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand .

london metal exchange copper inventor ##ies last week declined 13 , 57 ##5 tons , to 89 , 300 tons .
the l ##me stocks decline was about as expected , but the come ##x gain was n ' t .
however , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market , the analyst said .
` ` it was simply over ##bo ##ught , ' ' he said , and selling by funds that are computer guided helped de ##press prices .
futures prices eased , more in reaction to hurricane jerry than to any influence of the stock market .
the december contract ended with a loss of 0 . 22 cent a pound , at 74 . 48 cents .
prices rose sharply friday as the storm approached texas and louisiana , which is part of the mississippi delta cotton - growing area .
however , after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip late friday , mr . simon said .
that selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure , he said .
colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of texas and the northern states of the delta during the coming weekend , mr . simon said .
that has n ' t yet captured traders ' attention , he added .

it ended with a gain of 88 . 12 points .
by the market ' s close , volume on the new york exchange totaled more than 41 ##6 million , the fourth highest on record .
the big board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to black monday of 1987 .
but the rally was largely confined to the blue - chip stocks , which had been hard hit during friday ' s selling frenzy .
overall , more big board stocks lost money than gained .
indeed , the dow jones transportation average plunged 102 . 06 points , its second - worst drop in history .
world - wide , trading was generally manage ##able .
the frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets , with blue chips there falling 12 . 8 % .
other , more thin ##ly traded asian markets were hit harder than tokyo ' s , but there were no free - fall declines .

computers have increasingly connected securities markets world - wide , so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe .
so investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday ' s opening in tokyo , where the nik ##kei average of 225 blue - chip stocks got off to a rocky start .
the average plunged some 600 points , or 1 . 7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading .
but the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , closing down 64 ##7 .
unlike two years ago , most of japan ' s major investors chose to sit this cal ##ami ##ty out .
in merrill lynch & co . ' s tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process .

by 10 a . m . , it was down 49 .

but shortly before then , some of wall street ' s sharpe ##st traders say , they sensed a turn .
` ` it meant that people were n ' t running pe ##ll - mel ##l to the safety of bonds . ' '
stock traders were bu ##oy ##ed - - because an up ##turn in the mm ##i had also started the recovery in stocks on the tuesday following black monday .
` ` the mm ##i has gone better , ' ' shouted a trader in the london office of shear ##son lehman hutton .
shear ##son ' s london trading room went wild .
traders shouted out as their reuters , quo ##tron and tel ##erate screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on wall street .
then , nine minutes later , wall street suddenly rebound ##ed to a gain on the day .
` ` rally , rally , rally , ' ' shouted shear ##son ' s andy rosen .
major blue - chip stocks like philip morris , general motors and proctor & gamble led the rally .
german and dutch investors reportedly loaded up on kellogg co .

among big board specialists , the cry was ` ` pull your offers ' ' - - meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares .
` ` it was bed ##lam on the upside , ' ' said one big board specialist .
` ` what we had was a real , old - fashioned rally . ' '
this technical strength spurred buying from wall street ' s ` ` black boxes , ' ' computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bull ##ish periods .
typical , perhaps , was battery ##mar ##ch ' s dean le ##bar ##on .
asked what stocks the computer bought , the money manager says , ` ` i do n ' t know . ' '
over the weekend , clearing firms told the chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost monday morning .
` ` they were absolutely killed , slaughtered , ' ' said one chicago - based options trader .

instead , the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying .
the market closed minutes after reaching its high for the day of
across the country , many people took yesterday ' s events in stride , while remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general .

u . s . holders now own more than 60 % of blue arrow compared with 9 % last january .
the moves also could erase shareholders ' perception of blue arrow as a company in turmoil .
the proposed changes ` ` all make a lot of sense to me , ' ' he added .
mr . from ##stein solid ##ified his control in april by taking over from mr . berry as chairman .
under british rules , blue arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1 . 15 billion in good will arising from the purchase .
good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets .

that move , along with the return to the manpower name , could bo ##lster the company ' s prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help .

overall , pre ##ta ##x profit slid to # 18 . 49 million in the quarter from # 18 . 98 million a year earlier .

but analysts , while app ##lau ##ding the acquisition , say applied ' s chief executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two companies .
barry wright , acquired by applied for $ 147 million , makes computer - room equipment and vibration - control systems .
the water ##town , mass . , company ' s sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped .
the answer will help determine whether applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by mr . sim .
strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in august 1988 .
but mr . sim has set a fresh target of $ 50 a share by the end of
applied , then a closely held company , was st ##ag ##nat ##ing under the management of its controlling family .
while profitable , it ` ` was n ' t growing and was n ' t providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , ' ' he says .
mr . sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at barry wright as it has at applied .
` ` with a little patience , these businesses will perform very sat ##is ##fa ##ctor ##ily , ' ' mr . sim says .
within about six months , ` ` things will be moving in the right direction , ' ' he predict ##s .
mr . sim figures it will be easier to turn barry wright around since he ' s now in the driver ' s seat .
when he came to applied , ` ` i did n ' t have the power to execute as i do today , ' ' he says .
he was named chief executive officer of applied in 1986 and became chairman last november .
at applied , mr . sim set growth as his first objective .
he took the company public in an offering that net ##ted applied about $ 12 . 6 million , which helped launch the company ' s acquisition program .

` ` the equity market was ill ##iq ##uid .
countered james maguire , chairman of specialists henderson brothers inc . : ` ` it is easy to say the specialist is n ' t doing his job .
when the dollar is in a free - fall , even central banks ca n ' t stop it .
spec ##ulator ##s are calling for a degree of liquid ##ity that is not there in the market . ' '
many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early friday afternoon on a warm autumn day - - because the stock market was so quiet .
final - hour trading accelerated to 108 . 1 million shares , a record for the big board .
at the end of the day , 251 . 2 million shares were traded .
the dow jones industrial ##s closed at 256 ##9 . 26 .
the dow ' s decline was second in point terms only to the 50 ##8 - point black monday crash that occurred oct . 19 , 1987 .
the dow fell 22 . 6 % on black monday .
on the exchange floor , ` ` as soon as ua ##l stopped trading , we braced for a panic , ' ' said one top floor trader .
several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed .
and 10 minutes after the ua ##l trading halt came news that the ua ##l group could n ' t get financing for its bid .
at this point , the dow was down about 35 points .
but as panic spread , spec ##ulator ##s began to sell blue - chip stocks such as philip morris and international business machines to offset their losses .
selling snow ##ball ##ed because of waves of automatic ` ` stop - loss ' ' orders , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels .
most of the stock selling pressure came from wall street professionals , including computer - guided program traders .
traders said most of their major institutional investors , on the other hand , sat tight .
under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange , trading was temporarily halted in chicago .
as a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart .
the futures halt was even ass ##ailed by big board floor traders .
` ` it screwed things up , ' ' said one major specialist .
` ` we did n ' t even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do . ' '
the dow industrial ##s were down 55 points at 3 p . m . before the futures - trading halt .
big board chairman john j . ph ##ela ##n said yesterday the circuit breaker ` ` worked well mechanically .
he camped out at a high - tech nerve center on the floor of the big board , where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders .
but the build - up of s & p futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again .
at about 3 : 45 , the s & p market care ##ened to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again .
futures traders say the s & p was signaling that the dow could fall as much as 200 points .
during this time , small investors began ringing their broker ##s , wondering whether another crash had begun .
` ` i have a hu ##nch that this particular decline today is something ` more ad ##o about less . '
it would be my inclination to advise clients not to sell , to look for an opportunity to buy , ' ' mr . ball told the broker ##s .
and i think a lot of people will harp on program trading .
it ' s going to bring the debate right back to the forefront . ' '
as the dow average ground to its final 190 . 58 loss friday , the s & p pit stayed locked at its 30 - point trading limit .
while friday ' s de ##ba ##cle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning , traders said .
stock - index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than index ##es of the stock market itself .
but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today .
the de - link ##age between the stock and futures markets friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation .
the big board ' s mr . grass ##o said , ` ` our systemic performance was good . ' '
but the exchange will ` ` look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks .
mr . ph ##ela ##n said , ` ` it will take another day or two ' ' to analyze who was buying and selling friday .
ports of call inc . reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n ' t disclosed .
the agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring .
earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of boeing co . 70 ##7 ##s because of increasing maintenance costs .
the $ 40 ##9 million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ 300 million in secured lia ##bilities on those properties , according to those making the bid .
hooker ' s philosophy was to build and sell .
l . j . hooker , based in atlanta , is operating with protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code .
its parent company , hooker corp . of sydney , australia , is currently being managed by a court - appointed provisional liquid ##ator .
the thornton mall opened sept . 19 with a big ##g ' s hyper ##market as its anchor ; the columbia mall is expected to open nov . 15 .
the consortium was put together by ho ##are gov ##ett , the london - based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of security pacific corp .
ho ##are gov ##ett is acting as the consortium ' s investment bankers .
l . j . hooker was a small home - building company based in atlanta in 1979 when mr . simpson was hired to push it into commercial development .
eventually mr . simpson and mr . hers ##cu had a falling out over the direction of the company , and mr . simpson said he resigned in 1988 .
in addition , robert sa ##kow ##itz , chief executive of the sa ##kow ##itz chain , is seeking funds to buy out the hooker interest in his company .
the mer ##ks ##ame ##r chain is currently being offered for sale by first boston corp .
reached in honolulu , mr . shi ##dler said that he believes the various hooker malls can become profitable with new management .
` ` these are n ' t mature assets , but they have the potential to be so , ' ' said mr . shi ##dler .
` ` managed properly , and with a long - term outlook , these can become investment - grade quality properties .
the week ' s total was up 6 . 2 % from 274 , 96 ##3 tons a year earlier .
the bills will be dated oct . 26 and will mature oct . 25 , 1990 .
they will be available in minimum denominations of $ 10 , 000 .
bids must be received by 1 p . m . ed ##t thursday at the treasury or at federal reserve banks or branches .
unlike the weekend before black monday , the funds were n ' t swamp ##ed with heavy withdrawal requests .
and many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week .
the boston firm said stock - fund redemption ##s were running at less than one - third the level two years ago .
as of yesterday afternoon , the redemption ##s represented less than 15 % of the total cash position of about $ 2 billion of fidelity ' s stock funds .
` ` this feels more like a one - shot deal .
people are n ' t panic ##king . ' '
friday ' s stock market sell - off came too late for many investors to act .
some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after friday ' s close would take place at today ' s closing prices .
stock fund redemption ##s during the 1987 de ##ba ##cle did n ' t begin to snow ##ball until after the market opened on black monday .
many have raised cash levels , which act as a buffer against steep market declines .
mario gabe ##lli , for instance , holds cash positions well above 20 % in several of his funds .
one reason is that after two years of monthly net redemption ##s , the fund posted net in ##flow ##s of money from investors in august and september .
` ` i ' ve let the money build up , ' ' mr . lynch said , who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes .
not all funds have raised cash levels , of course .
as a group , stock funds held 10 . 2 % of assets in cash as of august , the latest figures available from the investment company institute .
that was modest ##ly higher than the 8 . 8 % and 9 . 2 % levels in august and september of 1987 .
also , persistent redemption ##s would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash .
but a strong level of investor withdrawal ##s is much more unlikely this time around , fund managers said .
a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since black monday .
stock - fund sales have rebound ##ed in recent months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels .
many fund managers argue that now ' s the time to buy .
fidelity ' s mr . lynch , for his part , snapped up southern co . shares friday after the stock got hammered .
if the market drops further today , he said he ' ll be buying blue chips such as bristol - myers and kellogg .
major mutual - fund groups said phone calls were arriving at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday .
but most investors were seeking share prices and other information .
trading volume was only modest ##ly higher than normal .
still , fund groups are n ' t taking any chances .
they hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other s ##na ##gs that in ##fur ##iated some fund investors in october 1987 .
fidelity on saturday opened its 54 walk - in investor centers across the country .
in addition , east coast centers will open at 7 : 30 ed ##t this morning , instead of the normal 8 : 30 .
t . rowe price associates inc . increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests .
the baltimore - based group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money - market funds .
but most investors seemed to be ` ` in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode , ' ' said steven nor ##witz , a vice president .
and vanguard , among other groups , said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through .
in an unusual move , several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll - free phone lines .
the jan ##us group had a similar recording for investors .
several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize .
some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year ' s fat profits .
stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of 25 % through september , according to lip ##per analytical services inc .
` ` this is not a major crash , ' ' she said .
nevertheless , ms . ga ##rza ##relli said she was swamp ##ed with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders .
she added , ` ` if they all were bull ##ish , i ' d really be upset . ' '
the backdrop to friday ' s slide was markedly different from that of the october 1987 crash , fund managers argue .
two years ago , unlike today , the dollar was weak , interest rates were rising and the market was very over ##val ##ue ##d , they say .
this time , ` ` i do n ' t think we ' ll get a panic reaction .
the maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months .
now , those routes are n ' t expected to begin until jan .
boeing is also supposed to send to america west another 75 ##7 twin - engine aircraft as well as a 737 by year ' s end .
those , too , are almost certain to arrive late .
nevertheless , the company ' s reaction under ##sco ##res the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as boeing can have on other parts of the economy .
it also is sure to help the mach ##ini ##sts put added pressure on the company .
` ` i do n ' t think their customers would like it very much . ' '
america west , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be .
indeed , a random check friday did n ' t seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations .
southwest airlines has a boeing 737 - 300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time .
a spokesman for am ##r corp . said boeing has assured american airlines it will deliver a 75 ##7 on time later this month .
american is preparing to take delivery of another 75 ##7 in early december and 20 more next year and is n ' t anticipating any changes in that timetable .
no date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table .
the investment community , for one , has been anticipating a speedy resolution .
boeing ' s shares fell $ 4 friday to close at $ 57 . 375 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange .
still , he said , it ' s possible that the strike could last considerably longer .
` ` i would n ' t expect an immediate resolution to anything . ' '
he added that the company mis ##cal ##cula ##ted the union ' s resolve and the workers ' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime .
the union is continuing to work through its expired contract , however .
it had planned a strike vote for next sunday , but that has been pushed back indefinitely .
the planes , long range versions of the medium - haul twin - jet , will be delivered with pratt & whitney p ##w ##40 ##60 engines .
pratt & whitney is a unit of united technologies inc .
they can be c $ 1 billion plus , ' ' mr . richardson said .
` ` but we would n ' t go into them alone , ' ' and canadian utilities ' equity stake would be small , he said .
` ` ideally , we ' d like to be the operator - lc ##b - of the project - rc ##b - and a modest equity investor .
our long suit is our proven ability to operate ' ' power plants , he said .
the planned electric utility sale , scheduled for next year , is alone expected to raise # 13 billion , making it the world ' s largest public offering .
canadian utilities is n ' t alone in exploring power generation opportunities in britain , in anticipation of the privatization program .
the company said the improvement is related to additional co ##gen ##eration facilities that have been put into operation .
concord ##e trans - atlantic flights are $ 2 , 400 to paris and $ 3 , 200 to london .
in a centennial journal article oct . 5 , the fares were reversed .
diamond shamrock offshore partners said it had discovered gas offshore louisiana .
diamond shamrock is the operator , with a 100 % interest in the well .
diamond shamrock offshore ' s stock rose 12 . 5 cents friday to close at $ 8 . 25 in new york stock exchange composite trading .
kaufman & broad home corp . said it formed a $ 53 . 4 million limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in california suitable for residential development .
kaufman & broad , a home building company , declined to identify the institutional investors .
` ` there are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash .
` ` we usually operate in that conservative manner . ' '
the company is putting up only 10 % of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture .
when the price of plastics took off in 1987 , quantum chemical corp . went along for the ride .
the company out ##pace ##d much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew five ##fold in two years .
mr . st ##ook ##ey said of the boom , ` ` it ' s going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks . ' '
but now prices have nose - dive ##d and quantum ' s profit is plum ##met ##ing .
to a degree , quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so - called commodity plastics that per ##va ##de modern life .
having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices er ##od ##ing .
pricing cycles , to be sure , are nothing new for plastics producers .
and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the head ##y period that is just behind them .
` ` we were all wonderful heroes last year , ' ' says an executive at one of quantum ' s competitors .
` ` now we ' re at the bottom of the heap . ' '
at quantum , which is based in new york , the trouble is mag ##nified by the company ' s heavy dependence on plastics .
in the u . s . poly ##eth ##yle ##ne market , quantum has claimed the largest share , about 20 % .
in recent months the price of poly ##eth ##yle ##ne , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive .
bench ##mark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have ski ##dded to between 35 cents and 40 cents .
meanwhile , the price of et ##hyl ##ene , the chemical building block of poly ##eth ##yle ##ne , has n ' t dropped nearly so fast .
that disc ##re ##pan ##cy hurts quantum badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its et ##hyl ##ene needs .
by many accounts , an early hint of a price ro ##ut in the making came at the start of this year .
china , which had been putting in huge orders for poly ##eth ##yle ##ne , abruptly halted them .
` ` people were even ho ##arding bags , ' ' he says .
they recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks .
no one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to ha ##ggle .
one doubt ##er is george k ##rug , a chemical - industry analyst at op ##pen ##heimer & co . and a bear on plastics stocks .
noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained , he remarks , ` ` some say october .
he argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermine ##d by producers ' plans to expand production capacity .
a quick turn ##around is crucial to quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy .
the company is trying to carry out a three - year , $ 1 . 3 billion plant - expansion program started this year .
some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to di ##sp ##el takeover speculation .
some viewed his response - - that company directors review the divide ##nd regularly - - as nothing more than the standard line from executives .
but others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight - from - the - shoulder performance .
in any case , on the day of the meeting , quantum ' s shares slid $ 2 . 625 to $ 36 . 625 in big board trading .
on top of everything else , quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in morris , ill .
two workers died and six remain in the hospital .
this human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in quantum ' s fortunes .
until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade - group safety awards .
a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imp ##ond ##era ##ble into quantum ' s financial future .
when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business - interruption insurance is straightforward .
but the numbers become trick ##ier - - and subject to dick ##ering between ins ##ured and ins ##urer - - when demand is shifting .
` ` and then you still have to negotiate . ' '
quantum hopes the morris plant , where limited production got under way last week , will resume full operation by year ' s end .
the plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of quantum ' s poly ##eth ##yle ##ne production and 50 % of its et ##hyl ##ene production .
the plant expansion should strengthen the company ' s sway in the poly ##eth ##yle ##ne business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity .
by lifting et ##hyl ##ene production , the expansion will also lower the company ' s raw material costs .
quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals , prop ##ane marketing .
petrol ##ane is the second - largest prop ##ane distributor in the u . s . .
the largest , suburban prop ##ane , was already owned by quantum .
still , quantum has a crisis to get past right now .
some analysts spec ##ulate the weakening stock may yet attract a suit ##or .
the name surf ##acing in rumors is british petroleum co . , which is looking to expand its poly ##eth ##yle ##ne business in the u . s . .
he said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , woo ##ing them from jobs with advertising agencies .
` ` the studies - lc ##b - on closing the unit - rc ##b - could n ' t be completed until now , ' ' he said .
the group ' s president , peter chris ##ant ##hop ##oulos , was n ' t in his office friday afternoon to comment .
in recent years , u . s . steel ##makers have supplied about 80 % of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation .
some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the u . s . that are similar to quota ##s .
the bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quota ##s , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until march 31 , 1992 .
the u . s . termed its plan , a ` ` trade liberal ##ization program , ' ' despite the fact that it is merely an extension .
south korea , which had 1 . 9 % under the previous quota ##s , is set to get a small increase to about 1 . 95 % .
that increase rises to slightly more than 2 % of the u . s . market if a joint korean - u . s . steel project is included .
meanwhile , brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1 . 43 % share it has had in recent years .
japan has been shipping steel to total about 4 . 5 % of the u . s . market compared with a quota of 5 . 9 % .
but its quota has been as high as 6 . 9 % in 1984 .
japan , however , has agreed to cut its quota to about 5 % from 5 . 9 % previously .
japan , the ec , brazil , mexico and south korea provide about 80 % of the steel imported to the u . s . under the quota program .
the balance is supplied by a host of smaller export ##ers , such as australia and venezuela .
the u . s . had about an extra 2 % of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks .
that was essentially made up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from cutting japan ' s allowance .
although mr . pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year , he said el ##cote ##l will also benefit from moving into other areas .
foremost among those is the company ' s entrance into the public fa ##cs ##imi ##le business , mr . pierce said .
el ##cote ##l will provide a credit - card reader for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data .
mr . pierce said el ##cote ##l should realize a minimum of $ 10 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .
automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone , mr . pierce said , not just phones produced by el ##cote ##l .
mr . pierce estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ 5 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .
the company said the plan was n ' t adopted in response to any known offers for quest , a maker and market ##er of hospital products .
measuring cups may soon be replaced by tables ##poo ##ns in the laundry room .
the move stems from lessons learned in japan where local competitors have had phenomena ##l success with concentrated soap ##su ##ds .
` ` they do n ' t want to get caught again , ' ' says one industry watch ##er .
a p & g spoke ##sw ##oman confirmed that shipments to phoenix started late last month .
she said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others .
super ##con ##cent ##rates are n ' t entirely new for p & g .
the company introduced a super ##con ##cent ##rated lemon cheer in japan after watching the success of attack .
when attack hit the shelves in 1987 , p & g ' s share of the japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % .
with the help of lemon cheer , p & g ' s share is now estimated to be 12 % .
in the early 1980s , p & g tried to launch here a concentrated deter ##gent under the ariel brand name that it markets in europe .
but the product , which was n ' t as concentrated as the new cheer , bombed in a market test in denver and was dropped .
but p & g contend ##s the new cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading .
and retailers are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space .
` ` when shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , ' ' says hugh zur ##ku ##hl ##en , an analyst at sal ##omo ##n bros .
but with so many brands v ##ying for space , that ' s no longer the case .
if the new cheer sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own super ##con ##cent ##rates .
then retailers ` ` will probably push the - lc ##b - less - established - rc ##b - brands out altogether , ' ' he says .
competition is bound to get tough ##er if ka ##o introduces a product like attack in the u . s . .
it also has a product - testing facility in california .
some believe p & g ' s interest in a super ##con ##cent ##rated deter ##gent goes beyond the concern for the japanese .
` ` this is something p & g would do with or without ka ##o , ' ' says mr . zur ##ku ##hl ##en .
they expected a new barrage of demands that japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the u . s . .
mr . mo ##sb ##ache ##r called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade .
he said such results should be ` ` me ##asurable in dollars and cents ' ' in reducing the u . s . trade deficit with japan .
how such remarks translate into policy wo n ' t become clear for months .
american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach bet ##wen mr . mo ##sb ##ache ##r and mrs . hills .
but some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic .
others said the bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand .
and some said it reflected the growing debate in washington over pursuing free trade with japan versus some kind of managed trade .
` ` i think my line has been very consistent , ' ' mrs . hills said at a news conference saturday afternoon .
` ` i am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because i have a ferocious list of statutes to implement .
i do n ' t feel either hard or soft .
i feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade . ' '
she highlighted exclusion ##ary business practices that the u . s . government has identified .
but her main thrust was to promote the importance of world - wide free trade and open competition .
she said the trade im ##balance was mainly due to macro ##economic factors and should n ' t be tackled by setting quantitative targets .
at her news conference for japanese reporters , one economics journalist sum ##med up the japanese sense of relief .
` ` my impression was that you would be a scary old lady , ' ' he said , drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues .
` ` but i am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity . ' '
the u . s . share of the japanese market has been stuck around 10 % for years .
at one of her news conferences , mrs . hills said , ` ` i believe we can do much better than 20 % . ' '
but she stressed , ` ` i am against managed trade .
i will not enter into an agreement that st ##ip ##ulates to a percentage of the market .
traditional industries inc . said it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended june 30 and is seeking new financing .
the seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives , including seeking increases in its credit lines .
traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n ' t say if it expects to show a profit for the year .
in the year ended june 30 , 1988 , traditional reported net income of $ 4 . 9 million , or $ 1 . 21 a share .
the company did n ' t break out its fourth - quarter results .
separately , the company said it would file a delayed fiscal - year report with the securities and exchange commission ` ` within approximately 45 days . ' '
it said the delay resulted from difficulties in resolving its accounting of a settlement with the federal trade commission .
information international said it believes that the complaints , filed in federal court in georgia , are without merit .
closely held morris communications is based in augusta , ga .
the units that filed the suit are southeastern newspapers corp . and florida publishing co .
a spoke ##sw ##oman said sul ##ka operates a total of seven stores in the u . s . and overseas .
sy ##ms operates 25 off - price apparel stores in the u . s . .
the oil industry ' s mid ##dling profits could persist through the rest of the year .
` ` that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings ' ' for the industry in general , he added .
he did n ' t forecast phillips ' s results .
but securities analysts say phillips will be among the companies hard - hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third - quarter earnings .
so , too , many analysts predict , will ex ##xon corp . , che ##vron corp . and am ##oco corp .
typical is what happened to the price of et ##hyl ##ene , a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies .
it has plunged 13 % since july to around 26 cents a pound .
a year ago et ##hyl ##ene sold for 33 cents , peaking at about 34 cents last december .
a big reason for the chemical price retreat is over ##ex ##pan ##sion .
beginning in mid - 1987 , prices began accelerating as a growing u . s . economy and the weak dollar spurred demand .
now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower .
oil company ref ##iner ##ies ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n ' t material ##ize .
the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period .
in addition , crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier , further press ##uring profit ##ability .
during the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits .
crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year .
prices - - averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier - - have stayed well above most companies ' expectations .
demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerate ##s in the fourth quarter .
` ` we could see higher oil prices this year , ' ' said bryan jacob ##os ##ki , an analyst at pain ##ew ##eb ##ber inc .
that will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ 13 a barrel in the fourth quarter .
while oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse .
in the third quarter , they averaged about 5 % less than they were in 1988 .
last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use .
this summer , on the other hand , had mild ##er weather than usual .
` ` we ' ve been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices , ' ' said mr . cox , phillips ' s president .
` ` the la ##gging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected . ' '
going into the fourth quarter , natural gas prices are anywhere from 8 % to 17 % lower than a year earlier .
they plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high - technology products .
olive ##tti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984 .
a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u . s . is discussing the allegations with the italian government and coco ##m , but declined to confirm any details .
italian president francesco co ##ssi ##ga promised a quick investigation into whether olive ##tti broke coco ##m rules .
president bush called his attention to the matter during the italian leader ' s visit here last week .
olive ##tti has denied that it violated coco ##m rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities .
the bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export - control policies , reflecting un ##hea ##led divisions among several competing agencies .
however , these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about any further liberal ##ization .
the move closely follows a similar offer by sal ##omo ##n of warrant ##s for shares of hong ##kong & shanghai banking corp .
in trading on the stock exchange of hong kong , the shares closed wednesday at hk $ 4 . 80 each .
sal ##omo ##n will ` ` cover ' ' the warrant ##s by buying sufficient shares , or options to purchase shares , to cover its entire position .
va ##ga ##bon ##d hotels was controlled by mr . bo ##es ##ky , who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations .

however , the agreement was canceled in june 1984 .
but ho ##fi ' s first offer would have given ideal ' s other shareholders about 10 % of the combined company .
ideal ' s directors rejected that offer , although they said they endorsed the merger proposal .
under the agreement , ho ##fi will own 87 . 2 % of the combined company .
ideal ' s current operations will represent about 39 . 2 % of the combined company .
the transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by ideal shareholders .
ideal said it expects to complete the transaction early next year .
while corn and soy ##be ##an prices have slumped well below their drought - induced peaks of 1988 , wheat prices remain stubborn ##ly high .
and they ' re likely to stay that way for months to come , analysts say .
also supporting prices are expectations that the soviet union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months .
that would be the lowest level since the early 1970s .

the government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bush ##els .
but the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n ' t be felt until the second half of next year .

on the chicago board of trade friday , wheat for december delivery settled at $ 4 . 06 ##75 a bush ##el , unchanged .
fe ##rr ##uz ##zi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soy ##be ##an futures market .

brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in pl ##ent ##iful supply .
the price cut , one analyst said , appeared to be aimed even more at europe , where consumption of brazilian juice has fallen .
it ' s a dollar - priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in europe , the analyst said .
new york futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at mid ##year .
friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets .
on the new york mercantile exchange , west texas intermediate crude for november delivery finished at $ 20 . 89 a barrel , up 42 cents on the day .
on european markets , meanwhile , spot prices of north sea crude ##s were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel .
` ` this market still wants to go higher , ' ' said na ##uman barak ##at , a first vice president at shear ##son lehman hutton inc .
he predicted that the november contract will reach $ 21 . 50 a barrel or more on the new york mercantile exchange .
there has been little news to account for such bu ##oya ##ncy in the oil markets .
analysts generally cite a lack of bear ##ish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crude ##s .

in its lawsuit , ph ##arm ##ac ##ia is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction to block med ##che ##m from selling the am ##vis ##c products .
a med ##che ##m spokesman said the products contribute about a third of med ##che ##m ' s sales and 10 % to 20 % of its earnings .
it said it is considering ` ` all of its options in light of the decision , including a possible appeal . ' '
many papers throughout the country are also faced with a slow ##down in classified - ad spending , a booming category for newspapers in recent years .
until recently , industry analysts believed decreases in retail ad spending had bottom ##ed out and would in fact increase in this year ' s third and fourth quarters .
all bets are off , analysts say , because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains .
` ` retailers are just in di ##sar ##ray . ' '
gan ##nett ' s 83 daily and 35 non - daily newspapers reported a 3 % increase in advertising and circulation revenue .
revenue gained 6 % to $ 2 . 55 billion from $ 2 . 4 billion .
at dow jones & co . , third - quarter net income fell 9 . 9 % from the year - earlier period .
net fell to $ 28 . 8 million , or 29 cents a share , from $ 32 million , or 33 cents a share .
the year - earlier period included a one - time gain of $ 3 . 5 million , or four cents a share .
revenue gained 5 . 3 % to $ 404 . 1 million from $ 38 ##3 . 8 million .
the drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at the wall street journal and barron ' s magazine .
ad lina ##ge at the journal fell 6 . 1 % in the third quarter .
affiliated publications inc . reversed a year - earlier third quarter net loss .
companies with daily newspapers in the northeast will need the stable news ##print prices to ease damage from weak ad lina ##ge .
trouble on the east coast was likely offset by improved ad lina ##ge at the los angeles times , which this week also unveiled a redesign .
according to analysts , profits were also helped by successful cost - cutting measures at newsweek .
the news - weekly has faced heightened competition from rival time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market .
however , analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers , such as the miami herald and san jose mercury news .
the company , currently using about 80 % of its north american vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 .
now , gm appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s .
gm officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin .
the shut ##down ##s will idle about 3 , 000 canadian assembly workers and about 2 , 500 workers in ohio .
but canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate gm move that affects three u . s . car plants and one in quebec .
that announcement left union officials in van nu ##ys and oklahoma city uncertain about their futures .
the van nu ##ys plant , which employs about 3 , 000 workers , does n ' t have a product to build after 1993 .
he said he believes gm has plans to keep building a - body cars into the mid - 1990s .
union officials have taken a beating politically as a result .
di ##ssi ##dent ua ##w members have used the fi ##ero plant as a symbol of labor - management cooperation ' s failure .
canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeover ##s meet that standard .
the french company said the government gave it 30 days in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan .
both mer ##ieu ##x and con ##na ##ught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns .
he said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed .
mr . andre issued the ruling based on a recommendation by investment canada .
investment canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision .
the university is seeking to block the acquisition of con ##na ##ught by foreign interests , citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in canada .
the university is considering a settlement proposal made by con ##na ##ught .
officials for the two concerns , which are bidding c $ 30 a share for con ##na ##ught , could n ' t be reached for comment .
french state - owned rhone - po ##ule ##nc s . a . holds 51 % of mer ##ieu ##x .
the company said it planned to offer an und ##eter ##mined number of common shares in exchange for the 58 ##5 , 000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding .
weather ##ford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange .
the energy - services concern said , however , that in january 1990 , it may resume payments of divide ##nds on the preferred stock .
proceeds will be used to eliminate and rest ##ru ##cture bank debt .
weather ##ford currently has approximately 11 . 1 million common shares outstanding .
analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers , as a group , is estimated to have climbed between 11 % and 14 % .

the drug , introduced last year , is expected to generate sales of about $ 300 million this year .
` ` it ' s turning out to be a real blockbuster , ' ' mr . sw ##ei ##g said .
in last year ' s third quarter , lilly earned $ 171 . 4 million , or $ 1 . 20 a share .
the company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shed ##ding numerous companies with low profit margins .
the company ' s lean operation , analysts said , allowed sharp - rising sales from its cho ##les ##terol drug , lo ##pid , to power earnings growth .
lo ##pid sales are expected to be about $ 300 million this year , up from $ 190 million in 1988 .
in morris plains , n . j . , a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are ` ` in the ball ##park . ' '
the company was officially merged with bristol - myers co . earlier this month .
the company expects to achieve the 20 % increase in full - year earnings per share , as it projected in the spring , the spokesman said .
in the third quarter last year , p ##fi ##zer earned $ 216 . 8 million , or $ 1 . 29 a share .

the database software company said it expects a $ 2 million net loss for the fiscal first quarter ended sept . 30 .
it said analysts had been expecting a small profit for the period .
revenue is expected to be ` ` up modest ##ly ' ' from the $ 26 . 5 million reported a year ago .
relational technology reported net income of $ 1 . 5 million , or 12 cents a share , in the year - earlier period .
` ` while our international operations showed strong growth , our domestic business was substantially below expectations , ' ' said paul newton , president and chief executive officer .
a spokesman said the company ' s first quarter is historically soft , and computer companies in general are experiencing slower sales .
mr . newton said he accepted the resignation of thomas wilson , vice president of corporate sales , and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned .
the company said mr . wilson ' s resignation was n ' t related to the sales short ##fall .
relational technology went public in may 1988 at $ 14 a share .
it fell $ 1 . 875 a share friday , to $ 6 . 25 , a new low , in over - the - counter trading .
its high for the past year was $ 16 . 375 a share .
in the previous quarter , the company earned $ 4 . 5 million , or 37 cents a share , on sales of $ 47 . 2 million .
but laura cunningham ' s bronx , her childhood bronx of the ' 50 ##s , is something else altogether .
ms . cunningham , a novelist and playwright , has a vivid and dramatically outs ##ized sense of recall .
little lily , as ms . cunningham calls herself in the book , really was n ' t ordinary .
rosie rein ##vent ##ed this man , who may or may not have known about his child , as a war hero for lily ' s benefit .
rosie died young and lily has remembered her as a romantic figure , who did n ' t interfere much with her child ' s education on the streets .
` ` without official knowledge of sex or death , we flirt ##ed with both , ' ' she writes .
her friend diana ' s father was a professional thief ; they did n ' t seem to have any bedrooms at all .
maybe lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting .
when rosie died , her uncles moved in - - and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements .
they painted the apartment orange , pink and white , according to her instructions .
the book loses some momentum toward the end , when lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightful ##ly weird family .
for the most part , though , there ' s much pleasure in her sa ##uc ##y , po ##ignant probe into the mysteries of the babylonian bronx .
the bronx also figures in bruce jay friedman ' s latest novel , which flashes back to the new york of the ' 50 ##s .
for his sixth novel , mr . friedman tried to res ##us ##cit ##ate the protagonist of his 1972 work , ` ` about harry towns . ' '
` ` an l . a . solution , ' ' explains mr . friedman .
but it does n ' t take too many lines to figure harry out .
the 21 - square - mile area is contaminated with lead , zinc and other metals .
the agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval , the company said .
under the agreement , gulf must give the u . s . government 45 days ' advance written notice before issuing any divide ##nds on common stock .
the company ' s net worth can not fall below $ 185 million after the divide ##nds are issued .
gulf ' s net worth after those transaction must be at least $ 150 million .
separately , the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 to vote on its proposed reorganization .
` ` if we get rid of a lot of that nonsense , it will be a big plus . ' '
where ' s the guy who can say : ` enough is enough ' ' ' ?
` ` i did n ' t bother calling anybody ; i did n ' t even turn on tv . ' '
of course , established corporate management ##s often tend to app ##lau ##d the set ##backs of stock spec ##ulator ##s and takeover artists .
the real estate slump that ' s pushing down the price of new york office space and housing is also affecting the city ' s retail real estate market .
in manhattan , once - desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill .
there are about 2 , 000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1 , 200 to 1 , 500 .
` ` this further confuse ##s retailers , ' ' she says .
` ` they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ?
is this the wrong time to open a store ?
who is going to be in the space next door ? ' '
and , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau .
but on average , manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say .
that follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 .
the same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retail ##ing .
hardest hit are what he calls ` ` secondary ' ' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents .
weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail space vacant , ex ##ace ##rba ##tes the problem for landlord ##s .
it is also no comfort to landlord ##s and small new york retailers when the future of larger department stores , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt .
the trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in new york are be ##mo ##ani ##ng the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents .
certainly , the recent drop in prices does n ' t mean manhattan comes cheap .
new york retail rents still run well above the going rate in other u . s . cities .
madison and fifth avenues and east 57th street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon .
the thriving 34th street area offers rents of about $ 100 a square foot , as do up - and - coming locations along lower fifth avenue .
by contrast , rental ##s in the best retail locations in boston , san francisco and chicago rarely top $ 100 a square foot .
and rents on beverly hills ' rodeo drive generally do n ' t exceed about $ 125 a square foot .
the new york stock exchange said two securities will begin trading this week .
precision cast ##parts corp . , portland , ore . , will begin trading with the symbol pc ##p .
it makes investment casting ##s and has traded over - the - counter .
it will continue to trade on the international stock exchange , london .
the american stock exchange listed shares of two companies .
aim telephone ##s inc . , a par ##si ##ppa ##ny , n . j . , telecommunications equipment supply company , started trading with the symbol aim .
columbia laboratories inc . , miami , began trading with the symbol co ##b .
the pharmaceuticals maker had traded over - the - counter .
the national market system of the nas ##da ##q over - the - counter market listed shares of one company .
employee benefit plans inc . , a minneapolis health - care services company , was listed with the symbol e ##b ##pi .
this role reversal holds true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , justices th ##urg ##ood marshall , harry black ##mun and john stevens .
every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustration ##s that go with it , but in different ways .
justices brennan and stevens appear philosophical about it ; justices marshall and black ##mun appear fighting mad .
the four justices are no newcomers to dissent , often joining forces in the past decade to critic ##ize the court ' s conservative drift .
now , however , as the court ' s new five - member conservative majority continues to solid ##ify , victories for the liberals are rare .
the change is most dramatic for justice brennan , the last survivor of the mid - 1960s liberal majority under chief justice earl warren .
last term alone he cast 52 dissent ##ing votes in 133 decisions , with the contentious flag - burning ruling as his only big victory .
but justice brennan fore ##sa ##w his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissent ##s in a 1985 speech .
he , like justice brennan , considers dissent ##s highly important for the future , a point that has n ' t escaped legal scholars .
harvard law school professor laurence tribe says there is a ` ` generation - skipping ' ' flavor to current dissent ##s .
` ` brennan and marshall are speaking in their dissent ##s to a more distant future , ' ' he says .
justice black ##mun , who will turn 81 next month , also seems fei ##sty about his new role .
friends and associates who saw justice black ##mun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years .
and his outlook improved after successful cat ##ara ##ct surgery in august .
but his level of frustration showed in a recent , imp ##ass ##ioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in chicago .
a canadian bank bought another th ##rift , in the first rt ##c transaction with a foreign bank .
under these deals , the rt ##c sells just the deposits and the healthy assets .
these ` ` clean - bank ' ' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , to be sold later .
in these four , for instance , the rt ##c is stuck with $ 4 . 51 billion in bad assets .
the buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks , as has been the case with previous deals .
after that , the buyers may rep ##udi ##ate the rates paid by the former th ##rift ##s .
but it ' s uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps .
` ` these th ##rift ##s are beach ##ed whales , ' ' said bert ely , an industry consultant based in alexandria , va .
nc ##nb continued its for ##ay into the florida and texas markets .
nc ##nb will acquire university federal savings association , houston , which had assets of $ 2 . 8 billion .
nc ##nb texas national bank will pay the rt ##c a premium of $ 129 million for $ 3 . 5 billion in deposits .
nc ##nb also acquired freedom savings & loan association , tampa , fl ##a . , which had total assets of $ 900 million .
nc ##nb will pay the rt ##c a premium of $ 40 . 4 million for $ 1 . 1 billion in deposits .
nc ##nb will also acquire $ 266 million of freedom ' s assets from the rt ##c , which will require $ 875 million in assistance .
meridian will pay a premium of $ 30 . 5 million to assume $ 2 billion in deposits .
it will also purchase $ 84 ##5 million of the th ##rift ' s assets , with $ 1 . 9 billion in rt ##c assistance .
royal trust ##co will pay the rt ##c $ 25 million to assume $ 98 ##9 million in deposits .
it will also purchase $ 47 ##3 million in assets , and receive $ 550 million in assistance from the rt ##c .
the following issues were recently filed with the securities and exchange commission :

trans world airlines inc . , offering of $ 150 million senior notes , via dr ##ex ##el burnham .
but time , as part of the more cost - conscious time warner , wants to we ##an itself away from expensive gi ##mm ##ick ##s .
besides , time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tack ##y .
` ` give ##away ##s just give people the wrong image , ' ' said mr . he ##ine ##mann .
` ` that perception takes the focus off the magazine . ' '
time magazine executives predict ##ably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to ad ##vert ##iser ##s .
` ` we are trying to create quality and involvement . ' '
however , time executives used the same explanation when in october 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4 . 6 million to 4 . 3 million .
still , time ' s move is being received well , once again .
` ` a few drops in circulation are of no consequence .
it ' s not a show of weakness ; they are improving the quality of circulation while ins ##uring their profits . ' '
` ` the question is how much are we getting from each reader , ' ' said mr . he ##ine ##mann .
both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month .
when the news broke of an attempted coup in panama two weeks ago , sen . christopher dodd called the state department for a briefing .
` ` they said , ` follow cnn , ' ' ' he told reporters .
it is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks .
its niche as the ` ` network of record ' ' during major crises draws elite audiences around the world .
but for all its success , cnn has hit a plateau .
although viewers ##hip so ##ars when big news breaks , it e ##bbs during periods of calm .
` ` you ca n ' t live on that . ' '
to distinguish itself , cnn is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global - news program .
it is paying higher salaries - - after years of sc ##rim ##ping - - to lure and keep experienced staff ##ers .
and it is embark ##ing on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative - reporting team .
networks , like other consumer products , develop images in peoples ' minds that are n ' t easy to change .
it also takes money that cnn has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see .
and the cable - tv operators - - cnn ' s distributors and part owners - - like things just the way they are .
in addition , many cable - tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations .
that ' s less than one - third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks .
the brief attention viewers give cnn could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable - tv channels .
cnn ' s viewer habits have been molded by its format .
its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service .
it focused on building up its news bureau ##s around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks .
now , the push is on for more - distinctive shows .
` ` our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , ' ' says paul amos , cnn executive vice president for programming .
then there ' s ` ` the world today , ' ' the prime - time newscast featuring mr . shaw and ms . cr ##ier .
until now , cnn has featured its hollywood gossip show during the key evening period .
the evening news is also slated as cnn ' s stage for its big push into investigative journalism .
in august , the network hired award - winning producer pamela hill , the former head of news specials at abc .
the network ' s salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a less - experienced work force .
cnn recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they ' re still drastically under ##pa ##id compared with the networks .
says mr . mo ##sett ##ig : ` ` cnn is my wire service ; they ' re on top of everything .
but to improve , they ' ve really got to make the investment in people . ' '
in any case , cable - tv - system operators have reason to fear any tin ##ker ##ing with cnn ' s format .
they market cable - tv on the very grazing opportunities cnn seeks to discourage .
the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound .
admitted ##ly , the principle in the cases is the same .
but the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts .
and the facts , as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits , were different .
when you suggest otherwise , you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation .
the community rein ##ves ##tment act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received .
the transaction , announced in august , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in california ' s san joaquin valley .
valley federal , with assets of $ 3 . 3 billion , is based in van nu ##ys .
imperial corp . , based in san diego , is the parent of imperial savings & loan .
in the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $ 33 . 1 million .
call it the ` ` we ' re too broke to fight ' ' defense .
` ` if true , ' ' the court wrote , ` ` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on pr ##ude ##ntial grounds . ' '
but the court said it lacked enough financial information about sun ##belt and the f ##sl ##ic and sent the cases back to federal district court in dallas .
but a lawyer for tri ##land investment group , the developer of valley ranch , dismiss ##es such arguments as a ` ` defense du jo ##ur . ' '
` ` we ' re asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory , ' ' he says .
` ` we ' d take the valley ranch free and clear as a boo ##by prize .

south africa freed the an ##c ' s sis ##ulu and seven other political prisoners .
most of those freed had spent at least 25 years in prison .

thousands of residents of low - lying areas were ordered to evacuate as the storm headed north in the gulf of mexico with 80 mph winds .
the decision is the latest move in an es ##cala ##ting battle between the franchise ##es and mr . po ##sner that began in august .
d ##wg is a holding company controlled by mr . po ##sner .
we support all efforts to remove victor po ##sner from control of ar ##by ' s inc . and the ar ##by ' s system . ' '
that rise came on top of a 0 . 7 % gain in august , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .
but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers .
` ` i would say this is not bad news ; this is a b ##lip , ' ' he said .
` ` the core rate is not really out of line . ' '
all year , energy prices have sk ##ew ##ed the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods .
energy prices then plum ##met ##ed through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months .
overall , the index has climbed at a 5 . 1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the labor department said .
some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain .
he predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world - wide .
passenger car prices jumped 3 . 8 % in september , after climbing 0 . 5 % in august and declining in the late spring and summer .
many analysts said the september increase was a one - time event , coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models .
although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase .
prices for capital equipment rose a he ##ft ##y 1 . 1 % in september , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1 . 1 % .
food prices declined 0 . 6 % , after climbing 0 . 3 % in august .
meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0 . 8 % in september to $ 32 . 82 billion .
but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices , analysts said .
producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0 . 4 % in september , after dropping for three consecutive months .
city ##fed financial corp . said it expects to report a loss of at least $ 125 million to $ 150 million for the third quarter .
in the year - earlier period , city ##fed had net income of $ 48 ##5 , 000 , but no per - share earnings .
city ##fed ' s president and chief executive officer , john at ##herton , said the loss stems from several factors .
he said non ##per ##form ##ing assets rose to slightly more than $ 700 million from $ 51 ##6 million between june and september .
approximately 85 % of the total consisted of non ##per ##form ##ing commercial real estate assets .
accordingly , city ##fed estimated that it will provide between $ 85 million and $ 110 million for credit losses in the third quarter .
city federal operates 105 banking offices in new jersey and florida .
that action , city ##fed said , will result in a charge against third - quarter results of approximately $ 30 million .
all these actions , mr . at ##herton said , will result in a loss of $ 125 million to $ 150 million for the third quarter .
regulators also ordered cent ##rus ##t to stop buying back the preferred stock .
he said the th ##rift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision .
the suspension of a preferred stock divide ##nd is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution ' s health .
in march , regulators labeled cent ##rus ##t a ` ` troubled institution , ' ' largely because of its big junk - bond holdings and its operating losses .
in the same month , the office of th ##rift supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock divide ##nds until its operations were on track .
since april , it has par ##ed its high - yield bond holdings to about $ 89 ##0 million from $ 1 . 35 billion .
mr . paul said only about $ 150 million of the current holdings are trade ##able securities registered with the securities and exchange commission .
cent ##rus ##t and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuation ##s for the junk bonds .
the legislation requires th ##rift ##s to dive ##st themselves of junk bonds in the new , somber regulatory climate .
in american stock exchange composite trading friday , cent ##rus ##t common shares closed at $ 3 , down 12 . 5 cents .
he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds .
in the third quarter , for instance , cent ##rus ##t added $ 22 . 5 million to its general reserves .
most analysts and th ##rift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in july , long before now .
many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal .
branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution .
cent ##rus ##t said the branch sale would also reduce the company ' s large amount of good will by about $ 180 million .
critics , however , say the branch sale will make cent ##rus ##t more dependent than ever on broker ##ed deposits and junk bonds .
but much of what the europeans want to protect seems every bit as che ##es ##y as what they are trying to keep out .
so far , the french have failed to win enough broad - based support to pre ##va ##il .
a glance through the television listings and a few twists of the european television dial suggest one reason why .
while there are some popular action and drama series , few bo ##ast the high culture and class ##y production values one might expect .
one of france ' s most popular saturday night programs features semi - celebrities seeking out their grammar - school classmates for on - air reunion ##s .
a flemish game show has as its host a belgian pretending to be italian .
if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protection ##ist barriers , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get .
european programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that .
mega - hits in germany or italy rarely make it even to france or great britain , and almost never show up on u . s . screens .
attempts to produce ` ` pan - european ' ' programs have generally resulted in disappointment .
a u . s . - made imitation under the title ` ` almost anything goes ' ' flopped fast .
for the most part , what ' s made here stays here , and for good reason .
most british programming is more of an acquired taste .
there is , for instance , ` ` one man and his dog , ' ' a herd ##ing contest among sheep dogs .
european drama has had better , though still mixed , fortunes .
the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns .
it was front - page news in italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunn ##ed down in the series .
spain ' s most popular mini - series this year was ` ` jun ##cal , ' ' the story of an aging bull ##fighter .
` ` given a choice , everybody will watch a home - produced show . ' '
but frequently there is n ' t much choice .
thus , europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal .
until recently , national governments in europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising .
now , however , commercial channels are coming to most european countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly .
just last week , greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels .
the result is a new and huge appetite for programming .
the financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheap ##ly from its boss ' s other ventures .
after two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek french and british government clearance .
the companies hope for a final agreement by year - end .
the venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in european defense contracting .
in recent months , a string of cross - border mergers and joint ventures have res ##ha ##ped the once - balkan ##ized world of european arms manufacture .
already , british aerospace and french government - controlled thomson - cs ##f collaborate on a british missile contract and on an air - traffic control radar system .
but it may be weeks before ge ##c and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the source indicated .
a consortium bid , however , would dim ##ini ##sh ge ##c ' s direct role in fe ##rran ##ti and might consequently app ##ease ministry officials .
at least one potential ge ##c partner , mat ##ra , insists it is n ' t interested in fe ##rran ##ti .
` ` we have nothing to say about this affair , which does n ' t concern us , ' ' a mat ##ra official said sunday .
the missile venture , the british aerospace spoke ##sw ##oman said , is a needed response to the ` ` new environment ' ' in defense contracting .
the venture ' s importance for thomson is great .
thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other europeans .
to justify 50 - 50 ownership of the planned venture , thomson would make a cash payment to british aerospace .
annual revenue of british aerospace ' s missile business is about # 950 million , a thomson spokesman said .
british aerospace ' s chief missile products include its 17 - year - old family of rap ##ier surface - to - air missiles .
thomson missile products , with about half british aerospace ' s annual revenue , include the cr ##ota ##le surface - to - air missile family .
canadian crude production averaged about 1 . 69 million barrels a day during 1989 ' s first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level .
` ` there has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , ' ' he said .
mr . watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western canada .
that ranks canada as the fourth - largest source of imported crude , behind saudi arabia , nigeria and mexico .
` ` it ' s very much a growing concern .
but when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , ' ' he said .
the system currently has a capacity of 1 . 55 million barrels a day .
the service - center business was hurt by reduced margins and start - up costs associated with its joseph t . rye ##rson & son unit .
inland said its third - quarter results will be announced later this week .
predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately .
take microsoft corp . , the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bell ##we ##ther .
last week , microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended sept . 30 to increase 34 % .
the announcement caused the company ' s stock to surge $ 6 . 50 to close at $ 75 . 50 a share .
microsoft ' s surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for re ##ass ##urance ##s about the financial health of the computer firms .
` ` it ' s hard to know what to expect at this point , ' ' said peter rogers , an analyst at robertson stephens & co .
` ` the industry def ##ies characterization . ' '
international business machines corp . also is expected to report disappointing results .
apple computer inc . , meanwhile , is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended sept .
another contradictory message comes from business ##land inc . , a computer retailer .
this month , however , business ##land warned investors that results for its first quarter ended sept . 30 had n ' t met expectations .
the company said it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share , down from 25 cents a share in the year - earlier period .
while the earnings picture confuse ##s , observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer .
in computer publishing , a battle over type ##face ##s is hurting adobe systems inc . , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays .
until recently , adobe had a lock on the market for image software , but last month apple , adobe ' s biggest customer , and microsoft rebelled .
the short - term outlook for adobe ' s business , however , appears strong .
the company is beginning to ship a new software program that ' s being herald ##ed as a boon for owners of low - end printers sold by apple .
the program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material .
meanwhile , competition between various operating systems , which control the basic functions of a computer , spells trouble for software firms generally .
` ` it creates uncertainty and usually slow ##s down sales , ' ' said russ crabs , an analyst at sound ##view financial group .
mr . crabs said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of al ##dus corp . , maker of a widely used computer publishing program .
al ##dus officials could n ' t be reached for comment .
on the other hand , the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant .
a bus is the data highway within a computer .
` ` users do n ' t care about the bus , ' ' said daniel benton , an analyst at goldman , sachs & co .
he said apple ' s family of macintosh computers , for instance , uses four different buses ` ` and no one seems to mind . ' '
the gap between winners and la ##gga ##rds will grow .
in personal computers , apple , com ##pa ##q and ibm are expected to tighten their hold on their business .
at the same time , second - tier firms will continue to lose ground .
some la ##gging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether .
w ##yse technology , for instance , is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation .
mr . brown estimates w ##yse , whose terminals business is strong , will report a loss of 12 cents a share for its quarter ended sept .
personal - computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms .
` ` the guys that make traditional hardware are really being obsolete ##d by micro ##pro ##ces ##sor - based machines , ' ' said mr . benton .
a raft of new computer companies also has targeted this ` ` server ' ' market .
the population of all four states is on the ups ##wing , according to new census bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s .
the gains , to be sure , are rather small .
still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n ' t grown at all since 1981 .
between 1987 and 1988 , north dakota was the only state in the midwest to lose population , a loss of 4 , 000 people .
six of the 12 midwest ##ern states have been growing steadily since 1980 - - illinois , kansas , minnesota , missouri , south dakota and wisconsin .
the northeast has been holding its own in the population race .
seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including new york , which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s .
and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again .
at the same time , several states in the south and west have had their own population turn ##around .
seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population - - west virginia , mississippi , louisiana , oklahoma , montana , wyoming and alaska .
but the growth gap between the sun belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing .
thanks to modern medicine , more couples are growing old together .
and even after losing a spouse , more of the elderly are staying independent .
this does n ' t mean they ' re less likely to live alone , however .
that share has remained at about 24 % since 1970 .
what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouse ##s rather than with other relatives , such as children .
in 1988 , 10 % of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouse ##s , down from 15 % in 1970 .
as people get even older , many become widowed .
but even among those aged 75 and older , the share living with a spouse rose slightly , to 40 % in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 .
like their younger counterparts , the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives .
only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouse ##s in 1988 , down from 26 % in 1970 .
the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40 % from 32 % .
more people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially .
careers count most for the well - to - do
many affluent people place personal success and money above family .
at least that ' s what a survey by ernst & young and yank ##elo ##vich , clancy , shu ##lman indicates .
being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group .
unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super - rich .
average household income for the sample was $ 194 , 000 , and average net assets were reported as $ 77 ##5 , 000 .
the goal was to learn about one of today ' s fastest - growing income groups , the upper - middle class .
although they represent only 2 % of the population , they control nearly one - third of discretion ##ary income .
across the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive .
twenty percent do n ' t even feel they are financially well off .
many of the affluent are n ' t comfortable with themselves , either .
about 40 % do n ' t feel they ' re more able than others .
while two ##thi ##rds feel some guilt about being affluent , only 25 % give $ 2 , 500 or more to charity each year .
thirty - five percent attend religious services regularly ; at the same time , 60 % feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one ' s principles .
the number of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation ' s largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 .
the american bankers association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 .
the share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % . . . .
per - capita personal income in the u . s . grew faster than inflation last year , according to the bureau of economic analysis .
per capita personal income ranged from $ 11 , 116 in mississippi to $ 23 , 05 ##9 in connecticut . . . .
there are 13 . 1 million students in college this fall , up 2 % from 1988 , the national center for education statistics estimates .
about 54 % are women , and 44 % are part - time students .
trouble with a capital t and that rhymes with p and that stands for pool .
the council ' s action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been mali ##gned un ##just ##ly for years .
pool is hot in new york and chicago , he insists , where ` ` upscale , suit - and - tie places ' ' are adding tables .
with today ' s tough ##er drunk driving laws , he adds , ` ` people do n ' t want to just sit around and drink . ' '
at the lounge , manager elizabeth dyer wo n ' t admit patrons in jeans , t - shirts or tennis shoes .
but a majority of the addison council did n ' t buy those arguments .
introducing pool , argued council ##woman riley rein ##ker , would be ` ` dangerous .
it would open a can of worms . ' '
addison is no stranger to cans of worms , either .
the revelations embarrassed town officials , although they argued that the problems were n ' t as severe as the media suggested .
` ` i think there ' s some people worried about something pretty ridiculous , ' ' council ##man john nolan says .
` ` i thought this was all taken care of in ` the music man .
richard chamberlain dresses as a ` ` mainland ha ##ole , ' ' tucking in a hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves .
and the local expression for brother is ` ` bra ##h , ' ' not ` ` br ##ud ##dah . ' '
sorry , the show does not even have the one red ##eem ##ing quality of genuine local color .
of all the ethnic tensions in america , which is the most troubles ##ome right now ?
a good bet would be the tension between blacks and jews in new york city .
mr . mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates un ##cr ##itical ##ly .
he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates un ##cr ##itical ##ly .
he said that jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa .
of course , mr . mason did not use neutral language .
in addition , some of mr . mason ' s critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .
for example , the new york state counsel for the naacp said that mr . mason is ` ` like a dinosaur .
people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . ' '
in the hands of a ze ##alo ##t like lenny bruce , this double - edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .
but wi ##eld ##ed by a pro like jackie mason , it is a constructive form of mischief .
but these are not the differences that make headlines .
it ' s worth noting that both di ##sa ##pp ##roving relatives are immigrants .
at least , they both speak with strong accents , as do jackie and maddie .
it could n ' t be more obvious that ` ` chicken soup ' ' is being made from an old recipe .
and a safe one - - imagine if the romance in question were between an orthodox jew and a member of the nation of islam .
clearly , the question with ` ` chicken soup ' ' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will sim ##mer at all .
so far , the bubbles have been few and far between .
part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcom ##s , ever since the did ##actic days of norman lear , to preach about social issues .
to some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to en ##light ##en us about ethnic stereotypes by rev ##ers ##ing them .
even more problematic is the inc ##omp ##ati ##bility between sitcom preach ##iness and mr . mason ' s comic persona .
i ' m not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the catholic - jewish dispute over the carmel ##ite convent at auschwitz .
that issue , like racial tensions in new york city , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can sim ##mer .
at your age , jackie , you ought to know that you ca n ' t make soup without turning up the flame .
the official white house reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a 60 - year history of calm , right up through friday .
` ` the economy , ' ' he added , ` ` remains well - balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ' '
here ' s what ronald reagan said after the 1987 crash : ` ` the underlying economy remains sound .
there is nothing wrong with the economy . . . all the indices are up . ' '
after the 1929 crash , herbert hoover said : ` ` the fundamental business of the country . . . is on a sound and prosperous basis .
james robinson , 57 years old , was elected president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives .
charles j . lawson jr . , 68 , who had been acting chief executive since june 14 , will continue as chairman .
the former president and chief executive , eric w . mark ##rud , resigned in june .
law ##makers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was b ##lo ##ated with special - interest tax breaks and spending increases .
in addition , the companion deficit - reduction bill already passed by the house includes a capital - gains provision .
house - senate negotiations are likely to begin at mid ##week and last for a while .
but , he added , ` ` i believe republicans and democrats will work together to get capital - gains reform this year . ' '
` ` we do n ' t need this as a way to get capital gains , ' ' he said .
the senate ' s decision was a set ##back for president bush and will make approval of a capital - gains tax cut less certain this year .
such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month .
the senate bill was par ##ed back in an attempt to speed deficit - reduction through congress .
senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the streamlined bill .
a key is whether house republicans are willing to ac ##qui ##es ##ce to their senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions .
another big question hovering over the debate is what president bush thinks .
he has been resisting a stripped - down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital - gains tax cut .
the senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue - losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the house - passed bill .
mr . bent ##sen said he hopes the senate will consider that measure soon .
to the det ##rim ##ent of many low - income people , efforts to boost med ##ica ##id funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken .
sen . do ##le said that the move required sacrifice by every senator .
it worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue - losing provisions were stricken .
the senate also dropped a plan by its finance committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their social security benefits reduced .
in addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % ex ##cise tax on long - distance telephone calls .
it also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retire ##es .
also stricken was a five ##fold increase in the maximum occupational safety and health administration penalties , which would have raised $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 .
a provision that would have made the social security administration an independent agency was ex ##cise ##d .
the approval of the senate bill was especially sweet for sen . mitchell , who had proposed the stream ##lining .
the deficit reduction bill contains $ 5 . 3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990 , and $ 26 billion over five years .
the revenue - raising provisions , which affect mostly corporations , would :
- - close a loop ##hole regarding employee stock ownership plans , effective june 6 , 1989 , that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeover ##s .
- - curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities , such as zero - coup ##on bonds , that post ##pone cash interest payments .
- - raise $ 85 ##1 million by suspend ##ing for one year an automatic reduction in airport and air ##way taxes .
- - speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies , effective august 1990 .
- - with ##hold income taxes from the pay ##che ##cks of certain farm workers currently exempt from with ##holding .
- - change the collection of gasoline ex ##cise taxes to weekly from semi ##mont ##hly , effective next year .
- - restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swap ##ping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash .
the measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees .
the plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year .
- - removal of the u . s . postal service ' s operating budget from the federal budget , reducing the deficit by $ 1 . 77 billion .
- - increases in nuclear regulatory commission fees totaling $ 54 million .
- - direction to the u . s . coast guard to collect $ 50 million from users of coast guard services .

columbia savings is a major holder of so - called junk bonds .
new federal legislation requires that all th ##rift ##s dive ##st themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years .
columbia savings officials were n ' t available for comment on the down ##grade .
franklin savings association - l ##rb - ottawa , kan . - rr ##b - - -
` ` they perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these , ' ' said franklin president duane h . hall .
` ` i think it was a little premature on their part .
just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks , wall street suffered another severe attack of nerves .
or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like oct . 19 , 1987 , eventually turned out to be ?
here ' s what several leading market experts and money managers say about friday ' s action , what happens next and what investors should do .
` ` everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987 , ' ' he says .
` ` well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same .
if you ' re a technician , you obey the signals .
right now they ' re telling me to get the hell out and stay out .
i see a possibility of going to 220 ##0 this month . ' '
` ` most people , ' ' he says , ` ` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like . ' '
friday ' s big drop , she says , ` ` was not a crash .
this was an october massacre ' ' like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979 .
now , as in those two years , her stock market indicators are positive .
so she thinks the damage will be short - lived and contained .
` ` those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10 % - 12 % down , ' ' she says .
` ` this is exactly the same thing , as far as i ' m concerned . ' '
thus , she says , if the dow jones industrial average dropped below 245 ##0 , ` ` it would just be a flu ##ke .
as she calculate ##s it , the average stock now sells for about 12 . 5 times companies ' earnings .
she says that ratio could climb to 14 . 5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of ` ` fair value . ' '
friday ' s fall marks the start of a bear market , says mr . davis , president of ned davis research inc .
but mr . davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987 - style crash .
` ` there was a unique combination in 1987 , ' ' he says .
` ` margin debt was at a record high .
there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds .
the main thing was portfolio insurance , ' ' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses . ` `
a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject ' ' to it .
in 1987 , such selling contributed to a snow ##ball effect .
today could even be an up day , mr . davis says , if major broker ##age firms agree to refrain from program trading .
over the next several months , though , he says things look bad .
` ` i think the market will be heading down into november , ' ' he says .
` ` we will probably have a year - end rally , and then go down again .
sort of a two - step bear market . ' '
he expects the down ##turn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around 2000 sometime next year .
` ` that would be a normal bear market , ' ' he says .
` ` i guess that ' s my forecast . ' '
` ` i do n ' t think the market is going through another october ' 87 .
` ` i expect the market to open weaker monday , but then it should find some stability . ' '
he tick ##s off several major differences between now and two years ago .
unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year .
and unlike 1987 , the economy does n ' t appear to be in any danger of over ##hea ##ting .
but the economy ' s slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits ` ` is n ' t good , ' ' he says .
` ` so it ' s a very mixed bag . ' '
thus , he concludes , ` ` this is not a good environment to be fully invested ' ' in stocks .
` ` if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolio ##s , i would not do any buying .
but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio , so i would look to do some modest buying ' ' on behalf of clients . ` `
we ' re going to look for some of the better - known companies that got clock ##ed ' ' friday .
` ` i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , ' ' he says .
this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . ' '
nevertheless , he says a depression does n ' t appear likely .
` ` there is more res ##ili ##ency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , ' ' he says .
new york money manager mario gabe ##lli , an expert at spotting takeover candidates , says that takeover ##s are n ' t totally gone .
` ` companies are still going to buy companies around the world , ' ' he says .
examples are ` ` ford looking at jaguar , bells ##outh looking at lin broadcasting . ' '
these sorts of takeover ##s do n ' t require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so mr . gabe ##lli figures they will continue .
he thinks another crash is ` ` unlikely , ' ' and says he was ` ` ni ##bbling at ' ' selected stocks during friday ' s plunge .
he sees ` ` economic problems , financial problems ' ' ahead for the u . s . , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession .
` ` friday you could n ' t sell dollars , ' ' he says .
dealers ` ` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . ' '
mr . rogers wo n ' t decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go .
many people now claim to have predicted the 1987 crash .
mr . cu ##rz ##io says what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board .
if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks , he says , ` ` that could quiet things down . ' '
if not , ` ` we could go to 220 ##0 very soon . ' '
renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalent ##s , primarily u . s . treasury bills .
` ` t - bills probably are the right place to be , ' ' he says .
regarding the oct . 3 letter to the editor from rep . tom lan ##tos , chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing , alleging :
1 . that your sept . 28 editorial ` ` kangaroo committees ' ' was factual ##ly inaccurate and deliberately misleading .
i thought your editorial was factual ##ly accurate and deliberately el ##uc ##ida ##tive .
2 . that mr . lan ##tos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment .
he did repeat those nice pl ##ati ##tu ##des several times as an indication of his support for the constitution .
he used about 56 words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights .
unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5 , 000 words heap ##ing sc ##orn on the witnesses for exercising the fifth .
he sandwich ##ed his praise of constitutional meat between large lo ##aves of bi ##lio ##us commentary .
' ' that certainly is not the supposed ` ` distorted reading ' ' indicated by mr . lan ##tos .
3 . that his ` ` committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hu ##d .
my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court . . . etc . ' '
by any ` ` reasonable man ' ' criterion , mr . lan ##tos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted .
that ' s not a bad way to proceed , just somewhat different from standard american practice .
how was that practice referred to when i was in school ?
ah , yes , something called a star chamber .
of course , mr . lan ##tos dot ##h protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change .
everything that mr . lan ##tos says in his letter is partially true .
he ' s right about his subcommittee ' s responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hu ##d officials .
but if his explanation of motivation is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ?
why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and in ##ef ##fi ##ciency ?
such as , what happened when congress wanted to know about $ 400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ?
no , mr . lan ##tos ' s complaints simply wo n ' t wash .
it defended appropriate constitutional safeguard ##s and practical common sense .
- l ##rb - of course , we ' ve also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . - rr ##b -
the system is the problem , not an individual member .
it ' s when such slapping does n ' t occur that we ' ve got trouble .
i do not by any means defend hu ##d management .
the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when ` ` tail gunner joe ' ' mccarthy did his work .
the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person ` ` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . ' '
this privilege against self - inc ##rim ##ination pre ##cl ##udes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify .
the privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only .
baxter v . palm ##ing ##iano , 425 u . s . 308 - l ##rb - 1976 - rr ##b - .
absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify .
drawing the adverse inference in a non ##cr ##imi ##nal congressional hearing does not off ##end the fifth amendment shield against self - inc ##rim ##ination .
it was friday the 13th , and the stock market plum ##met ##ed nearly 200 points .
or is tri ##ska ##ide ##ka ##phobia - - fear of the number 13 - - justified ?
in academia , a so - called friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors .
robert ko ##lb and ricardo rodriguez , professors of finance at the university of miami , found evidence that the market is sp ##ook ##ed by friday the 13th .
but their study , which spanned the 1962 - 85 period , has since been shown to be jin ##xed by an un ##lu ##cky choice of data .
in the ' 70s , the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the you - know - what .
but the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to yale hirsch , a collector of stock market lore .
on the only other friday the 13th this year , the dow jones industrial average rose about four points .
professor ko ##lb says the original study , titled friday the 13th , part vii , was published tongue - in - cheek .
` ` it was - lc ##b - like - rc ##b - the friday before black monday ' ' two years ago .
whether una ##ns ##wer ##ed phone calls had any effect or not , nas ##da ##q stocks sank far less than those on the new york and american exchanges .
ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading .
by comparison , the new york stock exchange composite tumbled 5 . 8 % friday and the american stock exchange composite fell 4 % .
nas ##da ##q volume friday totaled 167 . 7 million shares , which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year .
the single - day record of 288 million shares was set on oct . 21 ,
most of the complaints about una ##ns ##wer ##ed phone calls came from regional broker ##s rather than individual investors .
there were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots .
it was n ' t intentional , we were all busy . ' '
everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time . ' '
but , he added , ` ` you can only take one call at a time . ' '
market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when im ##balance ##s occur .
on days like friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to .
when selling is so fr ##en ##zie ##d , prices fall steep ##ly and fast .
on friday , some market makers were selling again , traders said .
but , with profits sa ##gging on wall street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share stock ##pile ##s on hand .
` ` everyone was hitting everyone else ' s bid , ' ' he said .
so , while ot ##c companies incurred losses on friday , trading officials said the damage was n ' t as bad as it was in 1987 .
` ` two years ago we were carrying huge inventor ##ies and that was the big cu ##lp ##rit .
i do n ' t know of anyone carrying big inventor ##ies now , ' ' said mr . king of robinson - humphrey .
it helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago , he said .
` ` the pace of trading was orderly , ' ' he said .
nevertheless , the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence .
in the past , the ot ##c market thrive ##d on a firm base of small - investor participation .
` ` we were just starting to get the public ' s confidence back , ' ' lame ##nted mr . mu ##llins of dean wit ##ter .
mr . ce ##cin of piper ja ##ff ##ray says some action from government policy makers would alla ##y investor fears .
it wo n ' t take much more to ` ` scare the hell out of retail investors , ' ' he says .
the sellers on friday came from all corners of the ot ##c market - - big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers .
shear ##son ' s mr . da ##pu ##zzo said retail investors nervously sold stock friday and never returned to bargain - hunt .
institutional investors , which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter , were calm ##er .
` ` we had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as much panic , ' ' mr . da ##pu ##zzo said .
` ` if they could n ' t sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf . ' '
in addition , he said , some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some ot ##c stocks whose prices were beaten down .
nas ##da ##q ' s biggest stocks were hammered .
the nas ##da ##q financial index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped 2 % , or 9 . 31 , to 46 ##2 . 98 .
the ot ##c market has only a handful of takeover - related stocks .
mcc ##aw lost 8 % , or 3 1 \ / 2 , to 40 .
lin broadcasting , dropped 5 1 \ / 2 , or 5 % , to 107 1 \ / 2 .
commercial inter ##tech plum ##met ##ed 6 to 26 .
the issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled friday .

to be sure , big investors might put away their check ##books in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today .
they could still panic and bail out of the market .
but their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n ' t abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse .
mr . rogers spent half his cash on hand friday for ` ` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . ' '
he expects to invest the rest if the market weaken ##s further .
` ` i waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through , ' ' he said .
` ` i spent $ 30 million in the last half - hour . ' '
` ` there is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . ' '
the $ 56 billion california public employees retirement system , for one , added $ 1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago .
even friday ' s slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades .
mr . aw ##ad , however , worries that the market ` ` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days .
it can happen before you can turn around . ' '
he said he disc ##ern ##s many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re - emergence of computer ##ized program trading .
most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance he ##d ##ging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash .
even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim friday , money managers said .
mr . wei ##sman predict ##s stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again , trapping more investors .
` ` i think it will be a rig ##or mort ##is rally , ' ' he said .
meanwhile , friday brought a rep ##rie ##ve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally .
especially glee ##ful were the short sellers , who have been pounded by this year ' s market climb .
the shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price .
` ` we ' re ahead for the year because of friday , ' ' said the firm ' s kurt fe ##sh ##bach .
` ` we ' re not making a killing , but we had a good day .
neither vita ##rine nor any of the springfield gardens , n . y . , company ' s officials or employees have been charged with any crimes .
mr . nes ##bit also said the fda has asked bo ##lar pharmaceutical co . to recall at the retail level its ur ##ina ##ry tract anti ##biotic .
but so far the company has n ' t complied with that request , the spokesman said .
bo ##lar has denied that it switched the brand - name product for its own in such testing .
up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged , though unsuccessfully , ask ##o ' s dutch lawyers noted .
speaking through its dutch lawyers , ask ##o also disclosed it holds a 15 % stake in ah ##old .
it was previously thought ask ##o held a 13 . 6 % stake that was accumulated since july .
a spokesman for ah ##old said his company is confident of its own position and the prop ##riety of the preferred - share issue .
he termed ask ##o ' s legal actions as ` ` un ##pro ##ductive ' ' to international cooperation among european retailers .
` ` i ' d like to see that initiative , and i have n ' t .
there is n ' t a big shot , an agenda . ' '
a few hours later , the stock market dropped 190 points .
politicians tried to finger each other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that washington was sing ##ly responsible for wall street ' s wo ##es .
but mr . butcher ' s comments make one thing clear : some on wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy .
the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit - cutting bill .
- - for the last two weeks , the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a semi - public battle over international economic policy .
the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the fed has been resisting .
- - the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spat ##e of airline takeover ##s .
last month , transportation secretary sam skinner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by k ##lm royal dutch airlines .
but he has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision .
and he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for united airlines , which includes a big stake by british airways plc .
in many ways , the backdrop to friday ' s stock decline is ee ##rily similar to that of october 1987 ' s 50 ##8 - point crash .
then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold .
the treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the federal reserve .
but , barr ##ing further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n ' t seem likely this year .
they learned they could survive it without much problem . ' '
in that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around .
asked if the administration agreed , he curt ##ly replied : ` ` the ad ##mins ##tra ##tion will have to speak for itself . ' '
no one in washington was willing to take the blame for pro ##voking friday ' s drop in the stock market .
but some players were quick to seize the moment .
` ` investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were sp ##ook ##ed , ' ' he said .
the following u . s . treasury , corporate and municipal offerings are tentatively scheduled for sale this week , according to dow jones capital markets report :
$ 15 . 2 billion of three - month and six - month bills .

but he ' s not so sure about everyone else .
` ` and i think institutions are going to come in and buy . . .
if i sell now , i ' ll take a big loss . ' '
some ev ##in ##ced an optimism that had been rewarded when they did n ' t flee the market in 1987 .
at the annual congress of the national association of investors corp . at the h ##yat ##t regency hotel in minneapolis , the scene was calm .
some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the u . s . were attending when the market started to slide friday .
but robert show ##al ##ter , an official of the association , said no special bulletin ##s or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned .
in fact , some of the association ' s members - - long - term , buy - and - hold investors - - welcomed the drop in prices .
` ` we hope to take advantage of it , ' ' said john snyder , a member of a los angeles investors ' club .
he has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants .
there ' s no question that there ' s a general di ##sta ##ste for leverage among lend ##ers .
she and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash , although she still owns some tex ##aco stock .
others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand .
` ` we all assumed october ' 87 was a one - time shot , ' ' said san francisco attorney david greenberg .
` ` we told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime , come on back .
mr . greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and , to his regret , never went back even as the market soared .
this time he ' s ready to buy in ` ` when the panic wears off . ' '
still , he adds : ` ` we ca n ' t have this kind of thing happen very often .
when the little guy gets frightened , the big guys hurt badly .
merrill lynch ca n ' t survive without the little guy . ' '
small investors have tip ##to ##ed back into the market following black monday , but mostly through mutual funds .
individual investors are still angry about program trading , mr . qu ##ack ##en ##bush says .
but it ' s not only the stock market that has some small investors worried .
and , finally , there were the g ##lo ##ater ##s .
` ` i just stopped by to see how much i would have lost . ' '
would mr . ant ##ori ever get back in ?
when it comes to money : once bitten , 2 , 000 times shy .
the crowded field for notebook - sized computers is about to become a lot more crowded .
com ##pa ##q ' s series of notebook ##s extends a trend toward downs ##izing in the personal computer market .
one manufacturer already has produced a clip ##board - sized computer called a note ##pad , and two others have introduced even smaller ` ` palm ##tops . ' '
but those machines are still considered novel ##ties , with keyboards only a mu ##nch ##kin could love and screens to match .
all of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcase ##s .
one analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name .
` ` this is n ' t quite a notebook - - i call it a phone ##book , ' ' he says .
instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to ` ` read ' ' block printing .
some critics , however , say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory .
the market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be .
` ` whether it ' s $ 5 billion or $ 3 . 5 billion , it does n ' t matter .
consider the growth of portable ##s , which now comprise 12 % of all personal computer sales .
laptop ##s - - generally anything under 15 pounds - - have become the fastest - growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year .
responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromise ##s .
making computers smaller often means sac ##ri ##fi ##cing memory .
it also has pre ##cl ##uded use of the faster , more powerful micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s found in increasing numbers of desktop machines .
size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays .
the competitive s ##ni ##ping can get pretty petty at times .
a po ##quet spokesman , for example , critic ##izes the atari portfolio because it requires three batteries while the po ##quet needs only two .
despite the s ##ni ##ping , few question the in ##ev ##ita ##bility of the move to small machines that do n ' t make compromise ##s .
toward that end , experts say the real battle will take place between center - stage players like to ##shi ##ba , zenith and now com ##pa ##q .
but the d ##yna ##book product is twice as heavy and costs more than com ##pa ##q ' s .
com ##pa ##q is already taking aim at zenith ' s market share .
` ` we do n ' t look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , ' ' he argues .
analysts do n ' t see it that way .
the problem com ##pa ##q is going to have is that they wo n ' t be able to make enough of them . ' '
others undoubtedly will follow , but most analysts believe com ##pa ##q has at least a six - month lead on the competition .
honey ##well inc . and international business machines corp . received air force contracts to develop integrated circuits for use in space .
honey ##well ' s contract totaled $ 69 . 7 million , and ibm ' s $ 68 . 8 million .
boeing co . received a $ 46 . 7 million air force contract for developing cable systems for the minute ##man missile .
general dynamics corp . received a $ 29 million air force contract for electronic - warfare training sets .
gr ##um ##man corp . received an $ 18 . 1 million navy contract to upgrade aircraft electronics .
av ##co corp . received an $ 11 . 8 million army contract for helicopter engines .
the monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years .
the wholesale price index stood at 90 . 1 , compared with a 1985 base of 100 .
stocks of utilities held up relatively better than other market sectors during the sell - off .
and among the issues hitting new highs were detroit edison co . and niagara mohawk power corp .
of course , many more issues - - 93 - - hit new low ##s .
these included international business machines corp . , which during friday ' s session traded below $ 100 a share for the first time since june 1984 .
ibm closed at $ 102 , down $ 5 . 625 .
meanwhile , two initial public offerings brave ##d the cas ##ca ##ding market in their maiden day of national over - the - counter trading friday .
ford motor co . said it acquired 5 % of the shares in jaguar plc .
jaguar , the london stock exchange and the u . s . securities and exchange commission are being notified of the transactions , the company said .
general motors corp . said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with jaguar before ford began buying shares .
gm said it still is talking with jaguar about acquiring a minority interest .
that ' s because their broker ##s can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans .
in october 1987 , these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market .
typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value .
if the investor does n ' t put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the broker ##age firm may begin liquid ##ating the securities .
but some big broker ##age firms said they do n ' t expect major problems as a result of margin calls .
margin calls since friday ` ` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , ' ' a spokesman for shear ##son lehman hutton inc . said .
he said sc ##hwa ##b had increased margin requirements ` ` so customers have more of a cushion . ' '
he added : ` ` we learned a lesson in 1987 about vol ##ati ##lity .
av ##is inc . , following rival her ##tz corp . ' s lead , said it is backing out of frequent - fl ##ier programs with three airlines .
but it remains involved in programs with am ##r corp . ' s american airlines unit and delta air lines .
industry estimates put av ##is ' s annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million .
northwest and midway are two of the five airlines with which budget has agreements .
analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high .
budget said its frequent - fl ##ier costs are ` ` substantially below ' ' av ##is ' s level .
this year has been difficult for both her ##tz and av ##is , said charles finn ##ie , car - rental industry analyst at alex . brown & sons .
` ` they ' ve been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , ' ' he said .
cbs inc . is cutting ` ` the pat sa ##jak show ' ' down to one hour from its current 90 minutes .
` ` this will raise the energy level of the show . ' '
cbs will continue to program action - adventure shows to follow the sa ##jak hour .
but cbs news will extend its four - hour ` ` night ##watch ' ' by 30 minutes and begin at 1 : 30 a . m .
further fraction ##ing the late - night audience is the addition of the ` ` ars ##eni ##o hall show , ' ' syndicated by paramount communications inc .
tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ 450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .
tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week .
the company ' s u . s . performance was helped by ` ` a record quarter for new customers , ' ' he said .
tandem ' s new high - end computer is called cyclone .
prices for the machine , which can come in various configurations , are $ 2 million to $ 10 million .
analysts expect the new computer to wr ##est a he ##ft ##y slice of business away from ibm , the longtime leader in main ##frame ##s .
` ` obviously ibm can give bigger discount ##s to users immediately , ' ' said mr . weiss .
` ` the answer is n ' t price reductions , but new systems , ' ' he said .
` ` we ' re after a little bigger niche , ' ' he said .
the stock market ' s sw ##oon may turn out to be good news for the economy .
in one wild hour of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the bush administration has been trying to do , unsuccessfully , for weeks .
it is forcing the federal reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously ir ##re ##press ##ible dollar .
the resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could rein ##vi ##gor ##ate american business - - indeed , the entire economy .
after all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed as a bar ##ometer of the national economy .
when it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed .
that has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock - market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable .
the 1987 crash was ` ` a false alarm however you view it , ' ' says university of chicago economist victor za ##rno ##witz .
the market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation .
its spa ##sms ca n ' t be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to pre ##sa ##ge major shifts in the economy .
` ` the market today has a life of its own , ' ' john ak ##ers , chairman of international business machines corp . , said saturday .
` ` there ' s nothing rational about this kind of action . ' '
of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week .
the financial - services industry was battered by the 1987 crash .
but if the stock market does n ' t continue to plum ##met , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate .
the fed , which until friday had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets .
fed officials may protest that this does n ' t necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest - rate policies .
but the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the fed is likely to bring down short - term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .
the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the treasury was right about the over ##pr ##ice ##d dollar .
a modest drop in the dollar - - only a modest one , mind you - - would be welcomed by the u . s . .
another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n ' t so comforting .
in the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spur ##ted at an inflation - adjusted annual rate of 5 . 3 % .
` ` a lot of pen ##t - up demand is gone . ' '
- lc ##b - the effects - rc ##b - were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected .
what ' s more , the corporate borrowing bing ##e has n ' t aba ##ted in the past two years .
the more a company relies on borrowed money , the greater its sensitivity to an economic slow ##down .
a company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an una ##nti ##ci ##pate ##d storm ; a highly leverage ##d company may end up in bankruptcy court .
the fed , of course , knows that very well - - hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy this morning .
but , in the process , the fed risks reign ##iting inflation .
the biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n ' t recession , he reasons ; it ' s an outbreak of un ##con ##tro ##lled inflation .
in the end , the 1987 collapse suggested , the economy does n ' t move in locks ##te ##p with stock prices .
the economy does , however , depend on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign investors .
a panic on wall street does n ' t exactly inspire confidence .
surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before friday .
and if foreign investors become a tad more cautious - - well , the dollar ' s recent strength suggests that the u . s . can stand it .
on the bottom line , the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we ' ve been through this before .
two years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent depression .
the doom ##say ##ers had a rec ##eptive audience .
the prosperity that followed black monday permits a more optimistic view today .
at the very least , the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation ' s success in handling the last go - around .
the chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of ski ##dding prices in the commodity end of the business .
producers of commodity chemicals , the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers , have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers .
` ` this could be the first of five or six down quarters . ' '
a dow spoke ##sw ##oman declined to comment on the estimates .
first boston corp . projects that 10 of the 15 companies it follows will report lower profit .
most of the 10 have big commodity - chemical operations .
still , some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains , largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals .
du pont co . is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigment ##s , fibers and polymers .
analysts are divided over whether du pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its con ##oco inc . oil company .
the estimates for du pont range from $ 2 . 25 to $ 2 . 45 a share .
the st . louis - based company is expected to report again that losses in its g . d . sea ##rle & co . pharmaceutical business are narrowing .
most estimates for mons ##anto run between $ 1 . 70 and $ 2 a share .
but the commodity - chemical producers are caught on the downs ##ide of a pricing cycle .
by some accounts on wall street and in the industry , the inventory reductions are near an end , which may pre ##sa ##ge firm ##er demand .
but doubt ##ers say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s .
in the latest quarter , at least , profit is expected to fall sharply .
some analysts hedge their estimates for quantum , because it is n ' t known when the company will book certain one - time charges .
but the estimates range from break - even to 35 cents a share .
him ##ont , quantum and union car ##bid ##e all declined to comment .

the principal - only securities will be rep ##ack ##aged by bt securities into a freddie mac re ##mic , series 103 , that will have six classes .
the interest - only securities will be sold separately by bt securities .
the principal - only securities pay the principal from the underlying freddie mac 8 % securities , while the interest - only securities pay only interest .
the interest - only securities were priced at 35 1 \ / 2 to yield 10 . 72 % .
there were no major euro ##bon ##d or foreign bond offerings in europe friday .
the economy ' s temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week , with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation .
the most troubles ##ome report may be the august merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow .
economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in september reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow .
meanwhile , september housing starts , due wednesday , are thought to have inched upward .
` ` there ' s a possibility of a surprise ' ' in the trade report , said michael eng ##lund , director of research at mm ##s .
in any event , mr . eng ##lund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made .
` ` trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , ' ' he said .
exports are thought to have risen strongly in august , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said .
a rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report .
the consensus view expects a 0 . 4 % increase in the september cpi after a flat reading in august .
` ` auto prices had a big effect in the pp ##i , and at the cpi level they wo n ' t , ' ' he said .
he also says he thinks ` ` core inflation , ' ' which exclude ##s the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month .
he expects a gain of as much as 0 . 5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases .
housing starts are expected to quick ##en a bit from august ' s annual pace of 1 , 350 , 000 units .
economists say an august rebound in permits for multi ##fa ##mi ##ly units signaled an increase in september starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards .

` ` capital city ' ' is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented h ##ype by its producer , thames television .
the early episodes make you long for a re ##run of the crash of 1987 .
let ' s make that 1929 , just to be sure .
you need n ' t be a high - powered securities lawyer to realize the prospect ##us is guilty of less than full disclosure .
turned loose in shane long ##man ' s trading room , the yu ##pp ##ie dealers do little right .
judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , shane long ##man ' s capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week .
in the opening episode we learn that michelle , a junior bond trader , has indeed pulled off another million before lunch .
trouble is , she has lost it just as quickly .
rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world , michelle b ##lab ##s about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone .
little chance that shane long ##man is going to rec ##ou ##p today .
traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds , in the belief that the u . s . monthly trade figures will look lou ##sy .
the trade figures turn out well , and all those recently un ##loaded bonds spur ##t in price .
so much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second .
instead of closing ranks to protect the firm ' s reputation , the executive ' s internal rivals , led by a lou ##tish american , demand his resignation .
and it takes declan , the obligatory ladies ' man of the cast , until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey .
after all , this is n ' t old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money .
this attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of max , the trading room ' s most fl ##am ##boy ##ant character .
yu ##pp ##ily enough , he lives in a lavish ##ly furnished converted church , wears designer clothes and drives an antique car .
in producing and promoting ` ` capital city , ' ' thames has spent about as much as shane long ##man loses on a good day .
another half million qui ##d went for a volley of full - page advertisements in six major british newspapers and for huge posters in the london subway .
thames ' s u . s . marketing agent , donald ta ##ff ##ner , is preparing to do just that .

` ` we wo n ' t put any burden on farmers , ' ' he said .
any change of control in farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where farmers and its related companies are incorporated .
a spokesman for b . a . t said of the amended filing ##s that , ` ` it would appear that nothing substantive has changed .
that divide ##nd is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of farmers by b . a . t , the spokesman added .
` ` it would have severe implications for farmers ' policy holders . ' '
domestically built truck sales were down 10 . 4 % to 86 , 555 pickup ##s , vans and sport utility vehicles .
overall , sales of all domestic - made vehicles fell 11 . 9 % from a year ago .
without gm , overall sales for the other u . s . auto ##makers were roughly flat with 1989 results .
car sales fell to a seasonal ##ly adjusted annual selling rate of 5 . 8 million vehicles , the lowest since october 1987 .
the poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month .
furthermore , dealers contacted late last week said they could n ' t see any immediate impact on sales of friday ' s steep market decline .
all of the gm divisions except cadillac showed big declines .
cadillac posted a 3 . 2 % increase despite new competition from lex ##us , the fled ##ging luxury - car division of toyota motor corp .
lex ##us sales were n ' t available ; the cars are imported and toyota reports their sales only at month - end .
last year , gm had a different program in place that continued reward ##ing dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold .
aside from gm , other car makers posted generally mixed results .
ford motor co . had a 1 . 8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2 . 4 % increase in domestic truck sales .
chrysler corp . had a 7 . 5 % drop in car sales , echoing its generally slow performance all year .
however , sales of trucks , including the company ' s popular mini ##van ##s , rose 4 . 3 % .
honda motor co . ' s sales of domestically built vehicles plunged 21 . 7 % from a year earlier .
honda ' s plant in mary ##sville , ohio , was gear ##ing up to build 1990 model accord ##s , a honda spokesman said .
` ` we ' re really confident everything will bounce back to normal , ' ' he added .
firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall .
a - totals include only vehicle sales reported in period .
d - percentage change is greater than 999 % .
x - there were 8 selling days in the most recent period and 8 a year earlier .
percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume .

now , the network has opened a news bureau in the hungarian capital .
employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : ` ` s ##za ##bad europa radio ' ' - - radio free europe .
in fact , the network hopes to set up offices in warsaw and anywhere else in the east bloc that will have it .
but the rapid changes brought on by g ##las ##nos ##t and open borders are altering the network ' s life in more ways than one .
in fact , radio free europe is in danger of suffering from its success .
while the network currently can operate freely in budapest , so can others .
in addition , competition for listeners is getting tough ##er in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled .
indeed , hungary is in the midst of a media explosion .
boys on busy street corners pe ##ddle newspapers of every political stripe .
news ##stand ##s are packed with a colorful array of magazines .
radio and television are getting live ##lier and bold ##er .
but radio free europe does n ' t plan to fade away .
they are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues : from bulgarian and bel ##orus ##sian to kazakh and ki ##rgh ##iz .
the establishment of its first bureau in warsaw pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in eastern europe .
it proved a perfect time for radio free europe to ask for permission to set up office .
` ` during the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios , ' ' says the writer .
` ` there were some very brave broadcasts . ' '
the listeners , too , had to be brave .
through much of the post - world war ii period , listening to western broadcasts was a crime in hungary .
` ` when we listen to the europe station , my mother still gets nervous , ' ' says a budapest translator .
` ` she wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . ' '
now , the tough ##est competition for radio free europe comes during the late - night slot .
hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight .
it is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss hungary ' s domestic problems as well as foreign affairs .
those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on sunday morning for ` ` sunday journal , ' ' on hungarian radio .
the competitive spirit is clearly influencing radio free europe , which is trying to beef up programs .
there ' s also a host of new programs , trying to light ##en up on the traditional diet of politics .
there ' s a program for women and a science show .
and to attract younger listeners , radio free europe inter ##sper ##ses the latest in western rock groups .
the pet shop boys are big this year in budapest .

the disease metaphor comes to mind , of course , not as an as ##pers ##ion on the advocates of national service .
why does the national - service virus keep coming back ?
perhaps it is because utopia ##n nostalgia ev ##oke ##s both military experience and the social gospel .
choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national service as much as the draft .
but the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose .
this time it attempted to invade two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans .
why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ?
military service , moreover , could be a national - service option .
a provision allowing grants to be applied to first - home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling .
they would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families .
opposition to national service from the pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military - service option being dropped .
clearly , a new rational ##e for national service had to be cooked up .
before the menu is printed , the house may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million .
is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such un ##sol ##ici ##ted assistance ?
on the contrary , it is as robust as ever .
even if government does see various ` ` un ##met needs , ' ' national service is not the way to meet them .
or we might provide a tax credit for working students .
what we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a gi bill .
will national service , in the current highly pol ##itic ##ized and op ##port ##uni ##stic form ex ##ert enough appeal to get adopted ?
polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing .
the omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected .

the canadian government announced a new , 12 - year canada savings bond issue that will yield investors 10 . 5 % in the first year .
the annual interest rate for each of the next 11 years will be set each fall , when details of a new series are released .
canada savings bonds are major government instruments for meeting its financial requirements .
the government has about 41 . 4 billion canadian dollars - l ##rb - us $ 35 . 2 billion - rr ##b - of such bonds currently outstanding .
only canadian residents are permitted to buy canada savings bonds , which may be red ##eem ##ed any time at face value .
at least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in congress this spring .
president bush has outlined his own youth entering service - l ##rb - yes - rr ##b - plan , though its details remain to be specified .
people eager to have youth ` ` pay their due ##s to society ' ' favor service proposals - - prefer ##ably mandatory ones .
to libertarian ##s , mandatory service is an ab ##omi ##nation and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money .
devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform :
if the market wo n ' t pay for it , they argue , it ca n ' t be worth its cost .
but what about those of us whose views are not pre ##de ##ter ##mined by formula or ideology ?
let ' s begin by recognizing a main source of confusion - - ` ` national service ' ' has no agreed meaning .
would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands ?
would the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ?
only males , as with the draft , or both sexes ?
middle - class people , or poor people , or a genuine cross - section ?
those are not trivial questions , and the label ` ` national service ' ' answers none of them .
as a starting point , here are five proposition ##s : 1 . consider the ingredients , not the name .
ignore ` ` national service ' ' in the abstract ; consider specific proposals .
2 . ` ` service ' ' should be service .
it involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or def ##er ##ring a career .
but the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high - school graduates with full - time jobs .
3 . encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not .
it is also un ##wise and une ##n ##force ##able .
- l ##rb - who will throw several hundred thousand refuse ##rs in jail each year ? - rr ##b -
but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior .
it should also encourage service - - prefer ##ably by all classes and all ages .
good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision - - all of high quality .
non - residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10 , 000 a year .
evaluation ##s suggest that good ones are - - especially so if the effects on participants are counted .
5 . under ##class youth are a special concern .
they can volunteer at any of thousands of non - profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers .
under ##class youth do n ' t have those opportunities .
they are not enrolled in high school or college .
and they have grown up in unprecedented ##ly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by self - destructive behaviors and bleak prospects .
but many of them can be quite profoundly re ##ori ##ented by productive and disciplined service .
some wo n ' t accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons .
but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed .
learning skills , producing something cooperative ##ly , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent - - others now depend on them .
strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service .
they are giving up no income , def ##er ##ring no careers , inc ##ur ##ring no risk .
it is what federal support should try hardest to achieve .

but the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market ji ##tters .
fed chairman greens ##pan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledge ##able sources , and insisted he had n ' t authorized any public comment .
nevertheless , fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayal ##s of the central bank ' s game plan .
it is prepared to assume the same role it played in october 1987 , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afl ##oat .
the fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions .
the re ##tic ##ence of federal officials was evident in the appearance sunday of budget director richard dar ##man on abc ' s ` ` this week . ' '
` ` secretary of the treasury brady and chairman greens ##pan and the chairman of the sec and others have been in close contact .
i ' m sure they ' ll do what ' s right , what ' s pr ##ude ##nt , what ' s sensible , ' ' he said .
but , in this context , that ' s the smart thing to do . ' '
at the treasury , secretary brady issued a statement mini ##mi ##zing the stock market ' s drop .
` ` today ' s stock market decline does n ' t signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , ' ' he said .
` ` the economy remains well - balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ' '
but administration officials conceded that friday ' s drop carried the chance of further declines this week .
` ` the other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago .
i think that ' s less likely . ' '
nevertheless , fed chairman greens ##pan and vice chairman manuel johnson were in their offices sunday evening , monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world .
both the treasury and the fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments .
in tokyo , share prices dropped sharply by 1 . 7 % in early monday morning trading .
after the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower .
in the bush administration , the lead is being taken by treasury secretary brady , under ##se ##cre ##tary robert g ##lau ##ber and assistant secretary mu ##llins .
as a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises .
mr . brady was at the white house friday afternoon when the stock market ' s decline began .
he was quickly on the phone with mr . mu ##llins , who in turn was talking with the chair ##men of the new york and chicago exchanges .
later , mr . brady phone ##d mr . greens ##pan , sec chairman richard breed ##en and numerous contacts in new york and overseas .
aide ##s say he continued to work the phones through the weekend .
administration officials say president bush was brief ##ed throughout friday afternoon and evening , even after leaving for camp david .
he had frequent telephone consultation ##s with mr . brady and michael bo ##skin , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers .
government officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business - as - usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic .
ironically , mr . greens ##pan was scheduled to address the same convention in dallas on oct . 20 , 1987 .

resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks .
that ' s the advice of most investment professionals after friday ' s 190 - point drop in the dow jones industrial average .
no one can say for sure what will happen today .
and investment pro ##s are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months .
but they ' re nearly unanimous on one point : do n ' t sell into a panic .
investors who sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived to regret it .
even after friday ' s plunge , the dow jones industrial average was 48 % above where it landed on oct . 19 two years ago .
panic selling also was un ##wise during other big declines in the past .
the crash of 1929 was followed by a substantial recovery before the great depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began .
the ` ` october massacre ##s ' ' of 1978 and 1979 were scary , but did n ' t lead to severe or sustained down ##turn ##s .
indeed , some pro ##s see friday ' s plunge , plus any further damage that might occur early this week , as a chance for bargain hunting .
but most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat .
on the one hand , mr . front says , it would be mis ##guide ##d to sell into ` ` a classic panic . ' '
on the other hand , it ' s not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy .
` ` so it ' s more pr ##ude ##nt to wait and see how things stabilize . ' '
generally , it is n ' t wise to be in and out ' ' of the stock market .
mr . ib ##bots ##on thinks that this week is ` ` going to be a roller - coaster week . ' '
but he also thinks it is ` ` a good week to consider buying . ' '
` ` we ' re dedicated long - term investors , not traders , ' ' he says .
` ` we understand panic ##s and eu ##ph ##oria .
and we hope to take advantage of panic ##s and buy stocks when they plunge . ' '
one camp of investment pro ##s sees what happened friday as an opportunity .
over the next days and weeks , they say , investors should look for stocks to buy .
` ` stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price . ' '
his advice : ` ` you ought to be there with a basket catching them . ' '
and mr . craig expects to pick up more shares today .
` ` it will be chaotic at first , but i would not be buying if i thought we were headed for real trouble , ' ' he says .
he argues that stocks are reasonably valued now , and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of 1987 .
his firm favors selected computer , drug and pollution - control stocks .
other investment pro ##s are more pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic .
they say investors should sell stocks - - but not necessarily right away .
many of them stress that the selling can be orderly , gradual , and done when stock prices are rally ##ing .
he thinks the underlying inflation rate is around 5 % to 6 % , far higher than most people suppose .
he thinks government officials are terrified to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high .
so he thinks the government will er ##r on the side of re ##kind ##led inflation .
he says the oct . 6 employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to investors .
whether this insurance is worth ##while depends on the cost of an option .
the cost , or premium , tends to get fat in times of crisis .
thus , buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk .
the prices of puts generally did n ' t so ##ar friday .
but put - option prices may zoom when trading resume ##s today .
it ' s hard to general ##ize about a reasonable price for puts .
paying , say , 10 % for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return .

but the major ` ` circuit breakers ' ' have yet to be evaluated .
a deeper market plunge today could give them their first test .
but for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended .
that system is designed to separate computer - generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order im ##balance ##s in individual stocks .
one mer ##c broker compared the action in the s & p pit during the two freeze ##s to a fire at a well - drilled school .
the system worked the way we devised it to work . ' '
after re ##open ##ing for about 15 minutes , the s & p index tumbled to its 30 - point limit and the second freeze went into effect .
one observer estimated that 80 % to 90 % of the s & p traders ` ` were just standing around watching . ' '
the mm ##i and the s & p 500 are the two major index ##es used by program traders to run their computer ##ized trading strategies .
the programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987 crash .
the process of post - crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments .
in october 1987 , just after the market drop , washington was aw ##ash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated .
in addition , limits were placed on computer - driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets .
few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated .

after all , this free - market argument went , the dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century .

on ny ##se program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders .

` ` it is almost identical to the sony product , ' ' mr . ike ##n remarked , after seeing prototypes and pictures .
replied a justin salesman : ` ` exactly . ' '
the justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40 % below those of sony corp . of japan ' s ` ` my first sony ' ' line .
the visitor wax ##ed enthusiastic and promised to return .
mr . ike ##n , it turned out , was a private detective using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for sony .
his recording later turned up as a court exhibit .
since then , life has changed a lot for 61 - year - old leonard kaye , justin ' s owner .
` ` i have n ' t been able to get a decent night ' s sleep since this has been going on , ' ' he says .
` ` it ' s the most distracting thing in my life - - i ca n ' t even attend to my business . ' '
justin ' s plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrath ##ful multinational .
with considerable irony , the case also shows how completely japan has turned the tables on u . s . business .
americans used to complain bitterly about being under ##sol ##d by look - alike products from japan .
- l ##rb - sony itself declines to comment . - rr ##b -
if sony wins , mr . es ##linger says , its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas .
at worst , he adds , ` ` they ' d have to grind them all up and throw them away . ' '
mr . kaye denies the suit ' s charges and says his only mistake was taking on sony in the marketplace .
` ` i made a similar line and i produced it cheaper , ' ' he says .
the judge turned down an earlier sony request for such an order - - a decision upheld on appeal - - but sony returned with additional evidence and arguments .
though hoping to settle the case , justin vows to fight on , if necessary .
but the battle is more than justin bargain ##ed for .
` ` i had no idea i was getting in so deep , ' ' says mr . kaye , who founded justin in 1982 .
mr . kaye had sold cape ##tron ##ic inc . , a taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only to find he was bored .
with justin , he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in hong kong , beginning with mickey mouse radios .
the company has grown - - to about 40 employees , from four initially , mr . kaye says .
justin has been profitable since 1986 , adds the official , who shares his office with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of plush toys .
the brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models .
sony found a new market niche , but mr . kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower - priced competitor .
his products are n ' t exact copies of sony ' s but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color .
sony uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow - - and so does justin , on the theory that kids prefer these colors .
by last winter , justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in hong kong and new york - - and sony noticed .
he himself threatened to take the matter to the federal trade commission or u . s . justice department .
recalls mr . ba ##xley : ` ` our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone .
we never intended taking on sony - - we do n ' t have the resources . ' '
sony answered the empty threat with its real suit .
off and on since then , the companies have skirmish ##ed in court .
whatever its merits , sony ' s aggressive defense is de ##bil ##itating for justin .
mr . kaye says he has paid more than $ 70 , 000 in legal fees so far .
of sony , mr . kaye says : ` ` they know there ' s no way for them to lose .
they just keep digging me in deeper until i reach the point where i give up and go away . ' '
for now , though , he vows to hang in .

trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers .
stunned , they watched broker ##age houses mark down price quota ##tions on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades .
this cal ##ami ##ty is ` ` far from over , ' ' he says .
the shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from camp ##eau corp . , which created its u . s . retail ##ing empire with junk financing .

indeed , a moody ' s index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high - yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day friday .
the bond ' s yield dropped to 7 . 82 % , the lowest since march 31 , 1987 , according to technical data global markets group .
the main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190 . 58 - point drop in the dow jones industrial average .
nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the federal reserve to ease credit in the months ahead .
any sustained credit - easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities .
i do n ' t believe that ' s the case , but i believe that people are running scared .
even as trading in high - yield issues dried up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion of new junk bonds .
first boston estimates that in november and december alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4 . 8 billion of coup ##on interest payments .
` ` when the rally comes , insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will .
but such highly leverage ##d transactions seemed to have multiplied this year , casting a pal ##l over much of the junk market .
` ` last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , ' ' he says .
` ` this year , at best , it ' s in one in every five or six .
and our credit standards have n ' t changed one io ##ta . ' '
however , mr . mcnamara said the slide in junk is creating ` ` one hell of a buying opportunity ' ' for selective buyers .
for the moment , investors seem more preoccupied with the ` ` bad ' ' junk than the ` ` good ' ' junk .
` ` that really affected the market in that people started to ask ` what else is in trouble ? ' ' '
well before camp ##eau , though , there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever .
despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news :
- - in august , resorts international inc . , which sold more than $ 500 million of junk bonds , suspended interest payments .
meantime , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of aba ##ting .
moody ' s says the frequency of corporate credit down ##grade ##s is the highest this year since 1982 .
in addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the federal deposit insurance corp .
` ` what we ' ve begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying ex ##or ##bit ##ant compound interest .
businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings .
prices of treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plum ##met ##ing stock market .
the yield on the bench ##mark fell to 7 . 82 % , the lowest since march 31 , 1987 , according to technical data global markets group .
the ` ` flight to quality ' ' began late in the day and followed a pre ##ci ##pit ##ous fall in the stock market .
treasury ##s opened lower , reacting negatively to news that the producer price index - - a measure of inflation on the wholesale level - - accelerated in september .
prices of municipal ##s , investment - grade corporate ##s and mortgage - backed bonds also rose , but la ##gged behind their treasury counterparts .
investment - grade corporate bonds were up about 1 \ / 2 to 3 \ / 4 point .
but the yield spread between lower - quality , investment - grade issues and higher - quality bonds widened .
municipal bonds rose as much as 3 \ / 4 point .
still , the lesson is about the same : on friday the 13th , the market was sp ##ook ##ed by washington .
still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one fa ##lter ##ing bid is no reason to write down the value of all u . s . business .
and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the house last month .
there is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill .
it would be a good thing if congress started to decide issues one - by - one on their individual merits without trick ##ery .
for one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up - or - down vote .
since senate leaders have so far fog ##ged it up with procedural smoke ##screen ##s , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect .
especially so since president bush has been weakened by the panama fia ##sco .
to the extent that the ua ##l troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of washington ' s sticky fingers .
as the best opportunities for corporate restructuring ##s are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them .
worse , congress has started to jump on the skinner band ##wa ##gon .
so the ua ##l deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points .
congratulations , mr . secretary and mr . congressman .
in the 1987 crash , remember , the market was shaken by a danny ro ##sten ##kowski proposal to tax takeover ##s out of exist ##ance .
even more important , in our view , was the treasury ' s threat to thrash the dollar .
the treasury is doing the same thing today ; thankfully , the dollar is not under 1987 - style pressure .
also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling bing ##es .
they are in less danger of losing liquid ##ity simply because of tape la ##gs and clearing and settlement delays .
in any event , some traders see stocks as under ##pr ##ice ##d today , unlike 1987 .
there is nothing wrong with the market that ca n ' t be cured by a little co ##her ##ence and common sense in washington .
but on the bear ##ish side , that may be too much to expect .

mr . ko ##sko ##tas ' s credibility is , at best , problematic .
he has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forth ##right on numerous points .
nevertheless , the new democracy and communist parties herald his assertion ##s as proof of paso ##k com ##plicity .
two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the ko ##sko ##tas affair that paso ##k members of parliament voted to refer them to the special court .
but el ##uding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of dr ##ach ##mas mr . ko ##sko ##tas funnel ##ed into new democracy co ##ffer ##s .
despite convincing arguments , it was never established that mr . papa ##nd ##re ##ou personally ordered or directed the wire ##ta ##ps .
the central weakness of the ` ` scandals ' ' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kick ##backs .
but while verbal high jin ##ks alone wo n ' t help paso ##k regain power , mr . papa ##nd ##re ##ou should never be under ##est ##imated .
then , to butt ##ress his credibility with the left , he en ##tic ##ed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the paso ##k banner .
crucial as these elections are for greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle .
the country ' s future nato participation remains unsure , for instance .
greece also must rev ##amp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened common market cooperation .
greece ' s bilateral relations with the u . s . need attention soon as well .
for one , the current accord concerning u . s . military bases in greece laps ##es in may 1990 .
negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the june elections , but the clock is running .
the greek courts have decided in favor of extra ##dition in the rashid case , but the matter await ##s final approval from greece ' s next justice minister .
yet the possibility of another lash - up government is all too real .
if mr . papa ##nd ##re ##ou becomes the major opposition leader , he could ham ##st ##ring a conservative - led coalition .
also , he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in march .

it must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective .
specifically , it must understand how real - estate markets over ##rea ##ct to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities .
when a regional economy catches cold , the local real - estate market gets pneumonia .
in other words , real - estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plum ##met much further than a local economy in recession .
this was seen in the late 1960s in los angeles and the mid - 1970s in new york .
why do local real - estate markets over ##rea ##ct to regional economic cycles ?
metropolitan detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment .
area employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % .
however , the real - estate market was hurt even more .
for example , residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level .
once metropolitan detroit ' s economy rallied in the mid - 1980s , real estate rebound ##ed .
building permits , for example , soared a staggering 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 .
where , sa ##v ##vy corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today ' s opportunities ?
of course , some observers have to ##uted houston and denver for the past five years as a counter - cyclic ##al play .
but now appears to be the time to act .
metropolitan houston ' s economy did drop and then flat ##ten in the years after its 1982 peak .
in the mid - 1980s , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % .
the real - estate market suffered even more severe set ##backs .
the vacancy rate soared more than 20 % in nearly every product category , and more than 30 % of office space was vacant .
to some observers , the empty office buildings of houston ' s ` ` see - through skyline ' ' were indicative of a very troubled economy .
as usual , the real - estate market had over ##rea ##cted .
actually , the region ' s economy retained a firm foundation .
metropolitan houston ' s population has held steady over the past six years .
and personal income , after slump ##ing in the mid - 1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms .
today , metropolitan houston ' s real - estate market is poised for a significant turn ##around .
more than 42 , 000 jobs were added in metro houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , pet ##ro ##chemical processing , and the computer industry .
this growth puts houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last year .
and forecast ##s project a 2 . 5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years - - nearly twice the national average .
by some measures , metropolitan denver ' s economy has actually improved in the past four years .
its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle .
employment is now 4 % higher than in 1983 .
buying income in real dollars actually increased 15 % between 1983 and 1987 - l ##rb - the most recent year available - rr ##b - .
in a self - fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region ' s real - estate market all but collapsed in recent years .
housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 peaks .
what real - estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as houston ' s or denver ' s ?
vacancy rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to mid - 20 % range in a couple of years .

in a highly unusual meeting in sen . deco ##nc ##ini ' s office in april 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on lincoln .
mr . keating had complained that the regulators were being too ze ##alo ##us .
lincoln ' s parent company , american continental corp . , entered bankruptcy - law proceedings this april 13 , and regulators seized the th ##rift the next day .
the newly formed resolution trust corp . , successor to the bank board , filed suit against mr . keating and several others on sept . 15 .
mr . keating has filed his own suit , alleging that his property was taken illegally .
the cost to taxpayers of lincoln ' s collapse has been estimated at as much as $ 2 . 5 billion .
details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers .
sen . mccain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter ` ` fell between the cracks . ' '
that was in addition to $ 34 , 000 in direct campaign donations arranged by mr . keating to the ohio senator .
wilson ab ##ney , staff director of the ethics panel , would n ' t comment .
sen . ri ##eg ##le said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been ` ` entirely proper . ' '
sen . deco ##nc ##ini said , ` ` when all is said and done , i expect to be fully ex ##one ##rated . ' '
` ` why did n ' t the bank board act sooner ? ' ' he said .
` ` that is what common cause should ask be investigated .
trinity industries inc . said it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture 1 , 000 coal rail cars for norfolk southern corp .

when china opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979 , toy makers from hong kong were among the first to march in .
the toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the british colony .
but in the wake of the shooting ##s in beijing on june 4 , the hong kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on china .
although the manufacturers stress that production has n ' t been affected by china ' s political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites .
the toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about china ' s economic and political policies .
indeed , match ##box and other leading hong kong toy makers were setting up factories in southeast asia , especially in thailand , long before the massacre .
their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern china .
by divers ##ifying supply sources , the toy makers do n ' t intend to withdraw from china , manufacturers and foreign buyers say .
it would n ' t be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern china during the past decade .
hong kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border .
but re - exports , mainly from china , jumped 75 % , to hk $ 15 . 92 billion .
manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern china , where an estimated 120 , 000 people are employed by the toy industry .
in the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on southeast asia .
malaysia , the philippines and indonesia also are being studied .
the industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results .
introduced in mid - 1988 , the 15 - cent ##imeter - tall plastic turtles are based on an american comic book and television series .
other hong kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 .
nintendo buyers have little money left to spend on other products .
bank credit for china investments all but dried up following june 4 .
but , toy manufacturers and other industrialist ##s say beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export - oriented southern china .
they say china ' s trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to ham ##per production in guangdong .
` ` the chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , ' ' says mr . kwan of play ##mates .
solicitor general kenneth starr argued that the 1973 supreme court decision , roe vs . wade , recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect .
the administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion .
the case , hodgson vs . minnesota , will be argued nov . 29 .
the nation ' s no . 1 aluminum maker earned $ 226 . 3 million , or $ 2 . 56 a share , a year earlier .
revenue rose 11 % to $ 2 . 83 billion from $ 2 . 56 billion .
` ` it ' s disappointing , ' ' said william si ##ede ##nburg , an analyst with smith barney , harris up ##ham & co .
lower prices for aluminum ing ##ots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings , the company said .
` ` in addition , costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant out ##ages for modernization work , ' ' the company said .
the results were announced after the stock market closed .
and for six years , nbc , abc and cbs have negotiated with hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that .
but with foreign companies snapping up u . s . movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever .
even network executives , however , admit privately that victory - - either in congress or in talks with the studios - - is highly doubtful any time soon .
nbc ' s interest may revive the deal , which mgm \ / ua killed last week when the australian concern had trouble raising cash .
even if that deal is n ' t revived , nbc hopes to find another .
` ` our doors are open , ' ' an nbc spokesman says .
nbc may yet find a way to take a passive , minority interest in a program - maker without violating the rules .
but the networks ' push may only ag ##gra ##vate an increasingly bitter rift between them and hollywood studios .
both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin - syn restraints .
few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge .
and that ' s why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says .
such proclamation ##s leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend .
` ` they do n ' t seem to have an incentive to negotiate , ' ' says one network executive .
` ` and there ' s no indication that washington is prepared to address the rules .
that ' s the problem , is n ' t it ? ' '
nbc ' s mr . wright led the way in dec ##ry ##ing the networks ' inability to match a time - warner combination .
he spoke up again when the sony bid for columbia was announced .
with a qin ##te ##x deal , nbc would move into un ##cha ##rted territory - - possibly raising hack ##les at the studios and in washington .
he now runs policy communications in washington , consulting to media companies .
hence , nbc might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as mgm \ / ua .
but such con ##vo ##lu ##tions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication .
instead , abc will have to sell off the rights for a one - time fee .
the networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim - - for several years at the least .
six years ago they were tan ##tal ##izing ##ly close .
the reagan - era federal communications commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules .
but just eight days before the rules were to die , former president ronald reagan , a one - time actor , intervened on behalf of hollywood .
the networks and studios have bi ##cker ##ed ever since .
network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in washington , but that seems unlikely .
but he said mr . mark ##ey hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own .
and at the fcc , meanwhile , new chairman alfred c . si ##kes has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan .
recognition equipment inc . said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the u . s . postal service .
the government sued the company in april , seeking $ 23 , 000 and other unspecified damages related to an alleged contract - steering scheme .
mr . voss was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ 11 , 000 for his role in the scheme .
the five additional defendants were n ' t parties to the settlement .
a trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began sept . 27 in federal court for the district of columbia .
in a related development , recognition equipment said the postal service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional 120 days .
the postal service originally suspended the company oct . 7 , 1988 , and has been renew ##ing the ban ever since .
the company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension .
intel corp . reported a 50 % drop in third - quarter net income , partly because of a one - time charge for discontinued operations .
earning also fell from the year - ago period because of slowing micro ##chi ##p demand .
sales amounted to $ 77 ##1 . 4 million , down 1 . 7 % from $ 78 ##4 . 9 million .
but intel later succumbed to the stock market ' s plunge , closing at $ 31 . 75 , down $ 2 . 125 .
on friday , andrew s . grove , intel president and chief executive officer , said ` ` intel ' s business is strong .
our booking ##s improved as the quarter progressed and september was especially good .
for the full quarter , our booking ##s were higher than the previous quarter , and our book - to - bill ratio exceeded 1 . 0 . ' '
revenue amounted to $ 2 . 23 billion , up slightly from $ 2 . 15 billion .
walter sis ##ulu and the african national congress came home yesterday .
` ` i am happy to see the spirit of the people , ' ' said mr . sis ##ulu , looking da ##pper in a new gray suit .
as the crowd outside his home shouted ` ` an ##c , an ##c , ' ' the old man shot his fists into the air .
` ` i ' m inspired by the mood of the people . ' '
under the laws of the land , the an ##c remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in lu ##saka , zambia .
` ` things have gone too far for the government to stop them now .
and they called on the government to release nelson mandela , the an ##c ' s leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison .
without him , said mr . sis ##ulu , the freeing of the others ` ` is only a half - measure . ' '
but pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racial ##ly divided country .
the newly released an ##c leaders also will be under enormous pressure .
pretoria has n ' t forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government .
at last night ' s rally , they called on their followers to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid .
