the u . s . wants a higher won to make south korea ' s exports more expensive and help trim seoul ' s trade surplus .
many south korean business people want a dev ##al ##uation instead , arguing that the won ' s recent gains already have weakened the country ' s export performance .
mr . ro ##h also said south korea is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces .
seoul has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason the won ' s value remains heavily controlled .
great american bank said its board approved the formation of a holding company enabling the savings bank to pursue non ##tra ##ditional banking activities under a new federal law .
the proposed holding company ' s primary purpose would be to allow great american to continue engaging in real estate development activities , it said .
those activities generated $ 26 . 1 million in operating profit last year .
the new real estate unit would have a separate capital structure to comply with the law .
the consolidation is expected to save $ 1 million a year in administrative costs , a great american spokesman said .
dale lang , who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of ms . and sas ##sy , is candi ##d about the challenge he is taking on .
mr . lang admits that ms . is ` ` in dire straits ' ' and that sas ##sy needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive .
but the 57 - year - old publisher has moved quickly and bold ##ly to deal with the magazines ' problems .
last friday , he told the staff of ms . that the magazine in january would begin publishing without advertising .
` ` any fool can publish a money - losing magazine .
i want to publish one that succeeds , ' ' said mr . lang .
` ` for ms . , it ' s time to publish for the reader , not the ad ##vert ##iser . ' '
mr . lang said the former australian owners of sas ##sy were ` ` blind - sided by the moral majority . . . .
their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out . ' '
sas ##sy already has recovered ; circulation has quickly passed the 500 , 000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300 .
what ' s more , mr . lang says he has what all publishers wish for : a bon ##a fide niche .
` ` seventeen is written more for mothers , not their daughters , ' ' said mr . lang .
` ` but sas ##sy has a different spirit .
it gets more mail in a month than mccall ' s got in a year , and it ' s not from mothers .
i feel about sas ##sy like i did about working woman 10 years ago . ' '
mr . lang took on ms . and sas ##sy with the acquisition of matilda publications inc . by his newly formed lang communications .
lang owns 70 % of matilda , while ci ##tic ##or ##p owns the rest through its ci ##tic ##or ##p venture capital partners .
two weeks ago , ci ##tic ##or ##p and mr . lang pumped $ 800 , 000 into matilda just to keep the doors open .
working woman , with circulation near one million , and working mother , with 625 , 000 circulation , are legitimate magazine success stories .
the magazine success , however , was for years lack ##lus ##ter and un ##fo ##cus ##ed .
only recently has it been attractive ##ly redesigned and its editorial product improved .
success is expected to gain at least because of the recent folding of rival venture , another magazine for growing companies .
the venture , formed in 1986 , was supposed to be time ' s low - cost , safe entry into women ' s magazines .
in addition , mccall ' s put in a less than stellar performance .
until a recent comeback , it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation .
mr . lang feels that time ' s priorities changed .
today , mr . lang believes his magazines will offer what many women ' s magazines do n ' t .
` ` we write straight for women on their level , ' ' he said .
` ` we do n ' t have passive readers . ' '
mr . lang points out that even success , in part , fits the company ' s image , since about 30 % of its readers ##hip is female .
mr . lang has named carol tab ##er , 43 , as group publisher of new york - based lang communications .
she will oversee working woman , working mother and success magazines , and retain her post as publisher of working woman .
mr . lang says he is n ' t scouting new acquisitions , at least for now .
` ` we would have to go outside to banks to get the money and i am not ready to do that , ' ' he said .
` ` besides , we have enough on our plate .
there is plenty of work to be done on what we have .

the panel also warned rep . bates that any further violations ` ` may result in a recommendation that disciplinary action be considered . ' '

could the collapse of i - 880 have been prevented ?
the impact of the destruction of this 2 . 5 - mile stretch of highway was tragic ##ally measured in lost lives .
but there are other long - term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of california ' s infrastructure to withstand a major te ##mb ##lor .
cal ##tra ##ns in sacramento said total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated at around $ 500 million .
los angeles county supervisor kenneth hahn yesterday vowed to fight the introduction of double - deck ##ing in the area .
that te ##mb ##lor measured 6 . 1 on the richter scale ; tuesday ' s was
so why even consider stack ##ing freeway ##s now ?
reasons for the collapse of the ni ##mit ##z freeway were sketch ##y yesterday .
cal ##tra ##ns today uses a variation of the design mr . parker describes , with spiral ##ing steel rods inside .
officials of the state agency did n ' t have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement did n ' t hold up .
cal ##tra ##ns spokesman jim drag ##o in sacramento declined to identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work .
the firm brought in to strengthen the structure could be liable as well .
the results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken , mr . messina says .
given the seismic history of the bay area , ` ` it seems to me that a 6 . 9 earthquake is a fore ##see ##able event . ' '
cal ##tra ##ns ' mr . drag ##o defended the agency ' s work on the ni ##mit ##z freeway .
` ` the work was done properly , ' ' he said .
` ` basically , we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something the structure could n ' t withstand . ' '
` ` the reason is that the technology is such that we ' re not able to retro ##fi ##t multi - column structures , ' ' he said .
charles mccoy in san francisco and john r . ems ##h ##wil ##ler in los angeles contributed to this article .

the white house is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly .
in the aftermath of the california earthquake , president bush and his aide ##s flew into a w ##hir ##l ##wind of earthquake - related activity yesterday morning .
some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims , but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a white house in action .
mr . bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aide ##s were trying to head off criticism .
the white house already is talking of mr . bush visiting the california earthquake site this weekend .
he visited the hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so .
the ground ru ##pt ##ured along a 20 - to - 30 - mile stretch of the san andreas fault on tuesday , mr . johnson added .

but the public policy issues raised by earthquake damage will be difficult to address , mr . johnson predicted .
` ` the attention span of the public is short , ' ' he said .
rein ##for ##cing such old building stock , mr . johnson said , ` ` comes down to money .
and sooner or later , we have to do something about it . ' '

coca - cola co . may be about to int ##ens ##ify the cola wars .
other , as yet unnamed , cities will follow .
if all goes well , the product will be rolled out for national sales sometime next year , a coke spokesman said .
after the confusion surrounding the change of the coke formula in 1985 , coca - cola was reluctant to cl ##utter the classic name with a brand extension .
but now , the soft - drink giant appears willing to take the risk .
the coke spokesman said a caf ##fe ##ine - free classic should help increase volume of the original brand .
indeed , analysts have said that the absence of new products , among other factors , has limited sales growth throughout the industry .
coke introduced a caf ##fe ##ine - free sugar ##ed cola based on its original formula in 1983 .
it switched to a caf ##fe ##ine - free formula using its new coke in 1985 .
coke has been studying the possibility of introducing a caf ##fe ##ine - free classic for a year , a company spokesman said .
he said large increases in sales of other non - caf ##fe ##ine soft drinks make the timing right now .

dow chemical co . said third - quarter net income slipped 6 . 8 % from a record year - ago quarter .
the decline broke a streak of 10 quarters in which dow posted earnings increases .
sales in the latest quarter rose 2 % to $ 4 . 25 billion from $ 4 . 15 billion a year earlier .
dow closed at $ 94 . 625 a share , up 75 cents , in new york stock exchange composite trading .
dow would earn $ 14 . 85 a share for the year if it equal ##ed that year - ago fourth - quarter performance .
that acquisition could further dil ##ute earnings per share this year , the company spoke ##sw ##oman said .
dow has n ' t said exactly what impact the marion acquisition will have on 1989 earnings .
another problem was a 7 % increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by only 2 % .
sales for the latest nine months rose 7 . 7 % to $ 13 . 34 billion from $ 12 . 38 billion in the year - ago period .
while the book amp ##ly just ##ifies its sub ##ti ##tle , the title itself is dubious .
what shook america was not a battle for justice but for naked power , in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had demon ##ized .
mr . bro ##nne ##r seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way .
as mr . bro ##nne ##r himself says , the smell of ` ` raw meat ' ' was in the air .
perhaps because they won , mr . bo ##rk ' s attackers come through more vivid ##ly than his defenders .
ralph ne ##as was the organizing genius , whipping a conglomerate of pressure groups into an irresistible attacking force .
harvard ' s laurence tribe was the constitutional heavy , laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow .
sen . kennedy , never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground , em ##oted brilliant ##ly .
it achieved a good media play , and enabled sen . spec ##ter and others to vote against mr . bo ##rk out of ` ` conscience . ' '
the nomination still might have been salvage ##d if a number of democratic moderate ##s in the south and southwest had broken party lines .
demographics converge ##d with ` ` mainstream ' ' and demon ##izing to seal robert bo ##rk ' s fate .
mr . bo ##rk ' s opponents chose the battlefield , held it and kept it .
another ups ##hot , however , was the chilling message the bo ##rk hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the supreme court draws its talent .
unfortunately , the author simply does n ' t supply the philosophical frame to sustain his report ##oria ##l talents .
he has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture .
still , the long view of robert bo ##rk as constitutional think ##er must be a spot ##ty one .
the question of segregated schools , in brown vs . board of education , was such an issue .
in our time abortion has become another , best left to a line of supreme court decisions rather than to the chaos of 50 state legislatures .
what is certain is that if americans allow another happening like the de ##grad ##ing bo ##rk confirmation circus , it will be at their per ##il .
mr . le ##rner is a writer and historian living in new york .
what so ##the ##by ' s is doing closely resembles an under ##writing by an investment bank .
a corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a wall street firm , which purchases the securities outright , accepting the financial risk of finding buyers .
if the investment bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the issue ##r , it makes a profit .
at the initial sale last night , for example - - the sale featuring the impression ##ists masters - - bids totaled $ 116 million .
that was slightly above so ##the ##by ' s pre ##sal ##e estimate of $ 111 million .
normally , so ##the ##by ' s would have earned 20 % of the total in commissions .
explains a so ##the ##by ' s spoke ##sw ##oman , the statement ` ` means exactly what it says .
we have some level of financial interest ' ' in the collection .
` ` we do n ' t disclose specific ##s . ' '
it was the highest bid in history for a work of art .
but two weeks ago , so ##the ##by ' s said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully rep ##aid .
` ` there seems to be a lot of art for sale , but there ' s more competition .
the competition gives the seller the ability to cut a better deal , ' ' he says .
the do ##rran ##ce family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above $ 100 million , people familiar with the transaction said .
so ##the ##by ' s has been aggressively promoting the do ##rran ##ce sale .
at a news conference last may announcing plans for the auction , so ##the ##by ' s estimated its value in excess of $ 100 million .
more recently , so ##the ##by ' s has predicted the collection will fetch $ 140 million .
that ' s the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history .
meanwhile , so ##the ##by ' s guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world .
in such situations , he says , the house ` ` is going to put the best light on things . ' '
even if he were to change his stripes and become another milton friedman , however , he would still stand a good chance of losing a country .
mr . k ##ren ##z almost certainly will be a younger version of erich hon ##eck ##er , his rigid predecessor as dictator .
more recently , mr . k ##ren ##z has been in charge of east german security , and is the youngest member of the ruling pol ##it ##buro .
abandoning socialism means abandoning the east german state ' s reason for existence , and with it the justification for its watch ##dog ##s and its wall .
mr . k ##ren ##z may need a bit of time to consolidate his empire , which would do a lot to promote reunification scenario one .
the west german em ##bas ##sies in prague , budapest and warsaw are continuing to find refugees at their gates .
of course east germany , true to its tradition , could tighten its borders yet further .
two of the last gestures of the hon ##eck ##er regime were to close the border to czechoslovakia and install halo ##gen lights in some spots along the frontier .
but even if he effects a hyde - to - je ##ky ##ll transformation , he will face a serious ideological crisis and reunification scenario two .
the problem is one that east germany shares with other half - states , such as north korea , but one it must shoulder alone in the east bloc .
czech reformer ##s can recall the wilson ##ian ideals of the same period in their country .
even the soviet union has peter the great to red ##is ##co ##ver , should it choose to .
but east germany is merely ` ` the land of truly existing socialism . ' '
beyond that , it has to compete with west germany for a claim to the german identity .
up to now , the main weapon of the ` ` worker and peasant state ' ' has been the ideology of socialism .
with talk today of a second economic miracle in west germany , east germany no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league .
without moscow ' s military and party behind it , east germany runs the risk of di ##sin ##te ##grating .
there may be forces that would delay this scenario .
id ##eo ##logue ##s are the last to surrender , and germans are an ideological people .
id ##eo ##logue ##s on the other side of the border can also slow the process .
but within the government and in the think tanks outside it , many west germans maintain that they do n ' t want immediate reunification .
politically , this currently is wisdom - - particularly given a nervous neighboring france .
that ' s a question east germany ca n ' t answer easily , no matter what its new leader does .

but once that factor was eliminated , traders took profits and focused on crude oil inventor ##ies , mr . barak ##at said .
but some market players still think earthquake speculation could have more impact on the oil markets .
futures prices eased on indications of improvement in the industry ' s labor situation .
the december contract declined 1 . 85 cents a pound to $ 1 . 264 ##5 .
the analyst said it will take about two to three months before the mine begins to produce copper in significant quantities .
another analyst said the can ##ane ##a return to operation may not be as near as some expect .
nevertheless , the increasing likelihood that these two major supply disruption ##s will be resolved weighed on the market , the analysts agreed .
both of these mines are normally major suppliers of copper to japan , which has been buying copper on the world market .
` ` the focus for some time has been on the copper supply , and good demand has been taken for granted , ' ' he said .
` ` now that the supply situation seems to be improving , it would be best for traders to switch their concentration to the demand side . ' '
` ` along with these factors , other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy , which could mean reduced copper usage , ' ' he said .
according to one dealer , japan said it has only 40 , 000 tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by cuba under current commitments .
the announcement was made because of reports tuesday that cuba would delay shipments to japan scheduled for later this year , into early next year .
the dealer said the quantity mentioned in the japanese announcement is so small that it ' s meaningless .
one analyst said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather .
the dealer said india might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm .
that country recently bought 200 , 000 tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but did n ' t .
cattle prices have risen in recent weeks on speculation that the government ' s quarterly report will signal tighter supplies of beef .
among other things , the government is expected to report that the number of young cattle placed on feed ##lot ##s during the quarter slipped 3 % .
feed ##lot ##s fat ##ten cattle for slaughter , so a drop indicates that the production of beef will dip this winter .

a new drug to prevent the rejection of transplant ##ed organs has been successfully used on more than 100 patients at the university of pittsburgh , according to researchers .
but researchers say the drug , called fk - 50 ##6 , could revolution ##ize the transplant ##ation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates .
rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30 , 000 organ transplant ##s performed world - wide each year .
researchers began using the drug in february on patients who had received kidney , liver , heart and pan ##cre ##as transplant ##s .
only two of 111 transplant ##s have been rejected .
the drug , discovered in 1984 , is meta ##bol ##ized from soil fungus found in japan .
the pittsburgh patients are the first humans to be given the drug , which is made by fuji ##sa ##wa pharmaceutical co .
there are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond the university of pittsburgh , whose hospital performs the most transplant ##s in the world .
he said that the research team had no financial stake in the drug .
according to mr . lab ##and , ` ` screaming ' ' for price controls occurs when income redistribution ` ` threatens to hit home . ' '
to be sure , the threat has hit home down here .
allowing un ##con ##tro ##lled prices for nec ##ess ##ities would indeed short ##en the lines at stores , as he contend ##s .
rather , lines would dim ##ini ##sh because at higher prices many victims could not afford nec ##ess ##ities such as food and medical supplies .
moreover , essential relief supplies such as ice must be distributed throughout the population because of potential health problems from spoiled food and possible outbreak of disease .
such spill ##over effects give the state a right to intervene in the marketplace and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources .
fortunately , volunteers and charities are not motivated by self - interest , but by alt ##ru ##ism .
why should they have to co - exist with op ##port ##uni ##sts rushing in to turn a quick profit ?
the government is actually protecting ava ##ric ##ious ice - bag ##gers and other profit ##eers who can not see beyond their own short - term gain .
south carolina deserves an a for its quick and timely relief efforts .
mr . lab ##and , meanwhile , gets an a for his rot ##e recital of economic - efficiency arguments .
give him an f for his failure to understand the ethics of economic equity .
mr . lab ##and gives us an idea why economists ' predictions are usually wrong .
they set up absurd situations , detached from reality , and then try to reason from them .
price controls were ` ` so fe ##r ##vent ##ly embraced by charleston ' ' because price go ##ug ##ing in this situation is equivalent to looting .
since he concentrated on the economic folly of such ordinance ##s , he did n ' t mention certain other of their effects .
they divert law - enforcement resources at a time they are most needed for protecting lives and property .
also , rather than increase supplies , they reduce them and encourage ho ##arding .
and they , or even the prospect of them , discourage disaster prepared ##ness in the form of speculative advance stock ##ing of supplies by merchants .
should they , too , stop ` ` messing with ' ' his free market ?
maybe he thinks they should also sell to the highest bid ##der .
should they be required to pay claims based on ex ##or ##bit ##ant costs for labor and materials ?
mr . lab ##and should be ##ware , since he lives in south carolina .
in a free market , his insurance rates can be raised to recover insurance - company losses .
having been through several tornadoes and hurricanes , i have a different perspective .
mine comes from seeing thriving communities devastated - - but only temporarily .
their recovery came surprisingly fast , and always with the help of neighbors .
the shock of seeing homes destroyed and city services disrupted may cause some to confuse priorities such as the true economic value of a freeze ##r full of meat .
in texas after hurricane alicia , major grocery chains used their truck fleets to ship essential goods to houston , no go ##ug ##ing , just good will .
we here in the affected areas were da ##zzled by mr . lab ##and ' s analysis of time values and his comparisons of effectiveness concerning research and development .
his theoretical approach and its publication in this venerable paper are no doubt a noteworthy accomplishment for him .
the businesses sub ##sc ##ri ##bing to mr . lab ##and ' s effective price system will be remembered when normal ##cy returns .
perhaps , considering the value of our time , we will be unable to patron ##ize their establishments in the post - hugo era .
i ' m sure she ' ll appreciate what an efficient reaction to her problems the price system has created .
this seems to be the season for revival ##s in chicago .
revival ##s of a different sort also are being offered by our two major theater troupe ##s , the goodman and steppe ##n ##wo ##lf .
each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship , but both help explain why chicago remains a vital center of this country ' s regional theater movement .
the goodman is offering a modernized version of mo ##lier ##e ' s ` ` the mis ##ant ##hr ##ope ' ' through nov . 4 .
the original is a comedy about al ##ces ##te , a man who sees false ##ness and vanity in everyone except himself .
he is the jealous friend of phil ##int ##e , and the jealous lover of ce ##lim ##ene .
the play is filled with int ##rigue , dish ##ones ##ty and injustice .
otherwise , the scene remained ce ##lim ##ene ' s house in 1666 .
the wilbur translation is remarkable - - well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity .
mr . falls , the goodman ' s artistic director , took a recent adaptation by neil bartlett and significantly adapted it .
mr . bartlett had slim ##med mo ##lier ##e ' s cast of characters to six and set them in the london media world of thatcher ##ite britain .
mr . bartlett managed to more or less maintain mo ##lier ##e ' s alexa ##nd ##rine verse form , 12 syllable lines in r ##hy ##ming couple ##ts .
mr . falls kept the form , but american ##ized it with mr . bartlett ' s further help .
a 300 - year - old play may be easier to revive than one merely 25 .
when ` ` the homecoming ' ' was first produced on this side of the atlantic , actors and directors were rev ##ere ##ntial .
silence ##s were lengthy - - nobody moved or gestured .
nobody smiled onstage , and nobody in the audience was encouraged to laugh .
also , it was not a funny time over here , what with the vietnam war , the ' 68 democratic convention , assassination ##s and riots .
sam , max ' s brother , has escaped the flesh by working as a liver ##ied cha ##uf ##fe ##ur and never seeking a wife .
teddy , the eldest of max ' s sons , has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an american university .
the play concerns teddy ' s homecoming with his wife of six years , ruth .
curiously , randall ar ##ney as teddy seems the only cast member unable to get beyond the zombie approach to a pin ##ter character .
in the end , teddy returns alone to america , leaving ruth in max ' s chair .
within a year he hopes steppe ##n ##wo ##lf will move into a new 500 - seat theater on that site .
the troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats 211 and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one - set production .
steppe ##n ##wo ##lf needs the extra seats even more than the fly space .
it ' s currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13 , 000 who can be accommodated in its present dig ##s .
for all the attention that chicago theater has received during the past decade , not one new building has been devoted to it .
the rest , he is confident , can be raised .
his board members alone have pledged $ 800 , 000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations .
mr . saga ##n compares the importance of steppe ##n ##wo ##lf with orson welles ' s mercury theater in the ' 30 ##s .
but welles ' s theater company turned out to have a brief - - one might say a mer ##cu ##rial - - existence .
` ` that ' s ok , ' ' mr . saga ##n replies .
` ` let this building be steppe ##n ##wo ##lf ' s legacy to chicago theater . ' '

` ` our market got hit a lot harder on monday than the listed market , ' ' mr . bruno said .
` ` we ' re just recovering and getting back to business as usual .
i ' m encouraged by the action . ' '
the trading pace was busy , with 4 , 343 issues and 147 . 6 million shares changing hands .
advancing issues beat declining ones , 1 , 271 to 81 ##1 .
heading the list : insurance , construction and technology companies located in the san francisco bay area .
insurance - related stocks were mixed as investors tried to figure out how to assess the impact of the property damage and deaths on those concerns .
traders said property - casualty companies with the heaviest exposure in the san francisco area include the ot ##c ' s safe ##co and ohio casualty .
frank gil ##mart ##in , a trader who follows insurance stocks for fox - pitt ke ##lton , said his strategy was to sell early .
as well , reins ##urer ##s and insurance broker ##age companies will have improved profits .
but mr . gil ##mart ##in said the hurricane damage was n ' t extensive enough to prompt premium boost ##s .
` ` the companies just gave back what they had reserved for , ' ' he said .
` ` now , they ' ll have to increase their co ##ffer ##s to protect for the future and that means rate increases . ' '
safe ##co fell 1 \ / 8 to 32 5 \ / 8 on 46 ##2 , 900 shares .
ohio casualty rose 1 \ / 4 to 51 3 \ / 4 on 137 , 200 shares .

shares of biotechnology companies in the area were also higher .
chi ##ron was up 1 \ / 2 to 27 and ce ##tus gained 1 \ / 2 to 16 3 \ / 8 .
the stocks of computer - related companies located outside california improved , too .
microsoft advanced 1 7 \ / 8 to 80 1 \ / 2 and lotus development added 1 1 \ / 4 to 32 1 \ / 2 .

jaguar ' s american deposit ##ary receipts added 3 \ / 8 to 10 3 \ / 4 on volume of 1 . 1 million .
am ##gen rose 1 1 \ / 2 to 50 3 \ / 4 in heavy trading .
analysts figure am ##gen could benefit as a result of troubles facing its competitor , genetics institute , over the anti - an ##emia drug ep ##o .
but they said the c $ 30 - a - share bid , which was due to ex ##pire monday , may still be extended or varied .

mer ##ieu ##x officials are expected to meet with federal officials in ottawa today to discuss the decision .
sen . bradley has it in his mind that such a tax cut would un ##rave ##l the tax reform he helped engineer in 1986 .
but he knows that as many as 20 of his fellow democrats are disposed to vote for the cut , popular among their constituents .
as a result , he took the lead in arguing that the cut should be blocked on procedural grounds .
he helped persuade 10 of these senators to support him and majority leader george mitchell on these grounds .
denied a vote on substance , the go ##p leadership in the senate on friday morning was confronted with a hard choice .
the u . s . chamber of commerce has been in the forefront in supporting the bush proposal .
it endorsed the white house strategy , believing it to be the sure ##st way to victory .
two hours later , the first word emerged on capitol hill that the administration had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurance ##s from senate democrats .
he left a message accusing mr . dar ##man of selling out .
it was the senate republicans , though , who had edged away from the veto strategy .
the stock market reacted as mr . ra ##hn did , crumbling as it absorbed the news that mr . dar ##man ' s strategy had been abandoned .
the total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ 15 trillion .
the value traded on the exchanges is close to $ 3 trillion .
if the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled , would n ' t the value fall to the owners of the assets ?
indeed , the stock market ' s steady advance this year tracked with president bush ' s success in advancing his capital - gains proposal .
a 30 % cut in this year ' s capital gains alone amounts to roughly $ 50 billion .
mr . ra ##hn was pointing out an elephant rumbling through wall street while conventional wisdom had fastened on the ua ##l flea .
they are economists and financial reporters who sy ##mp ##athi ##ze with the view that a capital - gains tax cut benefits the rich .
yet they somehow think that wall street is indifferent to losing the tax cut that seemed so close friday morning and is now problematic .
the market rebound monday followed weekend assurance ##s from mr . dar ##man that the administration has other plans to win the cut , which is alive and well .
sen . bradley ' s argument is that a capital - gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run .
that is , with capital gains cut , the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone , and political realities will push up income - tax rates .
in this atmosphere , there would be no serious consideration of tax increases .
the struggle over capital gains is the most important game in town .

federal prosecutors said they have obtained a guilty plea from another person in the government ' s ongoing probe of illegal payments in the record industry .
pay ##ola is the practice of making illegal , undisclosed payments to radio station personnel in return for getting the stations to play certain songs over the air .
as part of his plea agreement with the government , the 44 - year - old mr . craig faces a maximum of three years in prison .
mr . craig and three others were indicted last year as part of that pay ##ola probe .
two other defendants previously pleaded guilty , and charges against the third were dropped .
companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .
the companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share .

otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300 - day estimate .

the verdict , reached late last week in cincinnati , may end an eight - year legal battle for the greensboro , n . c . , carpet maker .
glenn and sharon bee ##be of cincinnati had sued the com - pan ##y in 1981 after installing burlington carpets in their office .
the bee ##bes alleged that toxic fu ##mes from the carpets made them sick .
as a result of their illness , the bee ##bes said , they lost $ 1 . 8 million in wages and earnings .
in addition , they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances .
the case had been closely watched because attorneys anti ##ci ##pate increasing litigation nationally over the so - called sick - building syndrome .
plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become ` ` sick ' ' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead poll ##uta ##nts to build up inside .
anthony j . ia ##cio ##fan ##o , a lawyer for burlington , said the company believes the bee ##bes ' symptoms were not related to the carpet ##ing .
he said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the bee ##bes ' symptoms appeared months later .
catherine adams , the bee ##bes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits .
scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick - building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the bee ##bes filed the case , she said .
the bee ##bes now believe that a prime cu ##lp ##rit for their injuries was fu ##mes from an ad ##hesive used in the carpet ##ing .
the bee ##bes have not yet decided whether to appeal .
the appellate division of new york state supreme court dismissed six lawsuits attempting to block a $ 2 . 5 billion project planned for 42nd street in manhattan .
all but two of the 40 or so lawsuits that have been filed since the project ' s 1984 approval have been dismissed before the trial stage .
the two that remain have n ' t yet reached the pre - trial fact - finding stage .
state officials said the court ' s ruling clears the way for proceedings to condemn buildings in the area .
` ` this project is ready to move , ' ' said state urban development corp . chairman vincent te ##se .
but developers of four planned office towers caution ##ed that obstacles still remain .
also , he said , the partnership is waiting to see whether the appellate division ' s ruling will be appealed .
state and city officials are still negotiating with developers to reno ##vate historic theaters and build and operate a merchandise mart and hotel .
federal judge expands role of u . s . courts in extra ##dition decisions .
however , judge wei ##nstein wrote in his opinion late last month that terrorism and acts of war against civilians can not be defined as political acts .

he said that in this case he con ##cu ##rred with the state department ' s decision that mr . ahmad should be extra ##dit ##ed .
mr . ahmad ' s lawyer said he would appeal .
lawyers close to the case said they believed the ruling was unprecedented .

early in october , six arab nations in the persian gulf jack ##ed up prices sharply .
in 1956 , when britain , france and israel invaded egypt to seize the suez canal , arab producers cut off supplies to europe .
u . s . oil supplies , however , had peaked in 1970 and 1971 and by 1973 were declining .
imports , then six million barrels a day , came primarily from venezuela and canada .
but car - happy americans panicked , and so did the u . s . and other oil - consuming governments .
` ` shortage ' ' and ` ` crisis ' ' became buzz words , although neither really applied .
the em ##bar ##go lasted only six months , but the price hike ##s became a fact of life .

the figures do n ' t include substantial divide ##nds on holdings of bear ste ##arns stock .
the increase is noted in the broker ##age firm ' s latest proxy statement filed with the securities and exchange commission .
because it operates on a fiscal year , bear ste ##arns ' s yearly filing ##s are available much earlier than those of other firms .
the latest period includes 14 months instead of 12 because bear ste ##arns changed to a fiscal year ending in june instead of april .
william j . mont ##gor ##is , chief financial officer , defended the loft ##y salaries at bear ste ##arns .
however , bear ste ##arns has never had an un ##pro ##fi ##table year since its founding 65 years ago .
mr . mont ##gor ##is said the firm has a ` ` straight mathematical formula ' ' for determining compensation , based on the firm ' s earnings .
mr . carey will remain a member of the merchant bank ' s board .

the merchant bank also announced that finance director david e ##ward is taking early retirement for personal reasons .
his duties will be taken over by anthony richmond - watson , who has been elected deputy chairman .

just after midnight monday , federal spending started to drop by $ 16 billion .
what do you say we all close down the poker game , go home and bank the $ 16 billion ?
that ' s essentially what budget director richard dar ##man is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get .
if human beings ca n ' t cut federal spending honestly - - and they ca n ' t - - let the computers do it .
congress , with a measure of white house com ##plicity , has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills .
- l ##rb - indeed without earlier manipulation ##s , the current se ##quest ##er of $ 16 billion would have been even larger . - rr ##b -
we suspect voters are fed up with the fin ##ag ##ling .
under the law , gram ##m - ru ##dman ' s across - the - board - cuts in federal programs are supposed to be permanent .
social security and spending for poor people are exempt ##ed .
mr . dar ##man ' s inclination to save the se ##quest ##er was backed up yesterday by white house press secretary mar ##lin fitz ##water :
` ` there is some feeling here that the cuts are the way to go .
it will reduce spending in a very effective fashion . ' '
this attitude is being waved away by so ##phi ##stic ##ates around washington as little more than tough talk .
it looks to us like a golden opportunity for george bush to chop off at the knees all this talk about a tim ##id , un ##ser ##ious presidency .

the stock of applied power inc . , which split 2 - for - 1 in may , has risen since august 1988 .
in yesterday ' s edition , it was incorrectly stated that the company ' s share price has softened since august 1988 .
after all , they wo n ' t soon forget the stock bargain ##s that became available after the october 1987 crash .
but while they want to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now , they ' re afraid of being hammered by another terrifying plunge .
the solution , at least for some investors , may be a he ##d ##ging technique that ' s well known to players in the stock - options market .
called a ` ` married put , ' ' the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock .
it ' s like ` ` fire insurance , ' ' says harrison roth , the senior options st ##rate ##gist at cow ##en & co .
but most investment advisers do n ' t recommend using married puts all the time .
that ' s because the cost of buying put options eats into an investor ' s profit when stock prices rise .
` ` this is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire , ' ' says mr . roth .
` ` you always want your house ins ##ured , but you do n ' t always feel the need for your investments to be ins ##ured . ' '
in addition to he ##d ##ging new stock purchases , the married - put technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns .
in either case , the investor faces three possible outcomes :
- - if the stock goes up in price between now and the put ' s ex ##piration date , the put will probably ex ##pire worthless .
the worst - case scenario would be if the put ex ##pire ##s worthless .
- - if the price of the stock declines , the put will increase in value .
the put establishes a minimum selling price for the stock during its life .
when a stock falls below the put ' s strike price , the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit .
broker ##s handle such transactions through the options clearing corp . , which guarantees all option trades .
the accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks .
in this case , the investor ' s risk would n ' t exceed 3 . 6 % of the total investment .
to sim ##plify the calculations , commissions on the option and underlying stock are n ' t included in the table .
there are more than 650 stocks on which options may be bought and sold , including some over - the - counter stocks .
but some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then he ##d ##ging their individual holdings .
they can do this by purchasing ` ` index puts , ' ' which are simply put options on index ##es that match broad baskets of stocks .
for instance , the most popular index option is the s & p 100 option , commonly called the o ##ex .
it is based on the stocks that make up standard & poor ' s 100 - stock index .
unlike options on individual issues , index options are settled only in cash , and no stock is ever tender ##ed .
but while index options are convenient , they have several disadvantage ##s .
for one thing , an investor ' s portfolio might not closely match the s & p 100 .
as a result , the o ##ex insurance may or may not fully protect an investor ' s holdings in the event of a market decline .
so an investor who wanted to realize a profit on o ##ex puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck .
on the other hand , only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on friday .
normally , once the underlying investment is suspended from trading , the options on those investments also do n ' t trade .
ultimately , whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worth ##while depends on the cost of the options .
that cost rises in times of high market vol ##ati ##lity .
but it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit .
a call option is similar to a put , except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until ex ##piration .
selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock - market decline .
that ' s because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call .
but if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option , the stock is almost certain to be called away .
and in that case , the investor misses out on any major upside gain .
these calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and divide ##nds received from the stock .
all prices are as of monday ' s close .
hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit - reduction legislation faded as efforts to stream ##line the house version in advance of a house - senate conference broke down .

exports fell for the second month in a row , while imports rose to a record .
the number had a tr ##ou ##bling effect on wall street , suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may under ##lie last friday ' s stock market slide .
` ` this bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline , ' ' said norman robertson , chief economist for mellon bank .
the trade report drew yet another un ##sett ##ling parallel to october 1987 .
on oct . 14 of that year , the announcement of an unusually large august trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline .
the slide continued until the record 50 ##8 - point market drop on oct . 19 .
in 1987 , however , the news was the latest in a string of disappointment ##s on trade , while the current report comes after a period of improvement .
the bleak trade report was played down by the bush administration .
commerce secretary robert mo ##sb ##ache ##r called the worse ##ning trade figures ` ` disappointing after two very good months . ' '
but the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the u . s . trade deficit has run out of steam .
exports declined for the second consecutive month in august , slipping 0 . 2 % to $ 30 . 41 billion , the commerce department reported .
imports , on the other hand , leaped 6 . 4 % to a record $ 41 . 18 billion .
many economists contend that deep cuts in the u . s . budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur .
most economists expect the slowing u . s . economy to curb demand for imports .
but they fore ##see little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down .
` ` that must start with cutting the federal budget deficit . ' '
the jump in imports stemmed from across - the - board increases in purchases of foreign goods .

steve jobs took a step back from the frontier of personal - computer technology in an effort to spur sales of next inc . ' s new machine .
but the computer was proving a hard sell because of its high price , a lack of software and an optical data - storage device that was too slow .
the machine began shipping at the end of last year .
the closely held company has n ' t disclosed sales .
however , most universities that have bought the machines say they are buying small numbers for evaluation purposes .
universities can now buy a next computer without an optical storage device for $ 4 , 99 ##5 .
optical - storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer .
but the technology , while reliable , is far slower than the widely used hard drives .
` ` we ' re extremely committed to optical storage technology ' ' he said .
` ` we think everything will go this way in a few years . ' '
he said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives , but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices .
` ` but it will definitely boost next ' s sales . ' '
universities , however , say next ' s prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine .
broad acceptance of next ' s computer also is hind ##ered by difficulty in distributing software for it .
most software is distributed on cheap floppy disks , but the next computer does n ' t come with a device that reads them .
next ' s computer also needs more software applications , but mr . jobs said he expects more soon .
he said he expects lotus development corp . to introduce a next version of its popular 1 - 2 - 3 spreads ##hee ##t program in 1990 .
educators added that next needs to soon offer a color version of its computer .

their other staple has been corporate takeover ##s , often hostile and financed by junk bonds .
first , by making management focus on short - term results , they inhibit building for the future - - just the opposite of japan .
second , a long - term shareholder of a good company need n ' t worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily : it will bounce back .
but if a raider takes over when the stock is weak , the shareholder never gets his recovery .

u . s . exports benefited in august from heavy canadian spending on new plant and equipment and a pickup in canadian auto demand , canadian officials said .
industries in both countries have requested a speed ##up of tariff cuts on hundreds of products .
some tariffs were eliminated when the trade pact took effect jan . 1 .
the remainder were to be phased out in five or 10 annual installment ##s , with all tariffs eliminated by january 1998 .
the two countries aim to reach an agreement by early december on a package of accelerated tariff cuts that would take effect early next year .
canadian officials said the trade pact has kind ##led an export interest among many small canadian companies that previously had little or no foreign sales .

how soon wang will stage a comeback , or if it will at all , are still matters of debate .
like thousands of sales ##pe ##ople before them , wang ' s are finding ways to combat the bad news .
wang got into financial trouble because of b ##lo ##ated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecast ##s .
its mainline mini ##com ##put ##ers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers .
last year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing , and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising .

mr . miller veto ##ed that : ` ` even i ca n ' t understand all the foot ##notes , ' ' he says .
we tell them all the major companies are having financial difficulties . ' '
mr . miller says that after a sharp sales slump in july and august , sales stabilized in september .

` ` before the really bad news , we were looking at wang fairly seriously , ' ' she says .
but ` ` their present financial condition means i ' d have a hard time convincing the vice president in charge of purchasing . ' '
during the past year , wang has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president .
` ` they were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened . ' '
the first priority for wang ' s sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers .
wang ' s installed base is one of its greatest assets , and many of those customers remain extremely loyal .
the more recent losses were really devastating . ' '
new customers , the source of higher commissions for sales ##pe ##ople and the key to wang ' s long - term via ##bility , are even tough ##er .
mr . lynch left wang this summer for oracle systems inc . , a software vendor .
the financial problems are particularly frustrating for sales ##pe ##ople pushing wang ' s image systems , which convert paper forms to electronic documents .
consultants say that wang ' s technology is among the best available in the image market .
but sales ##pe ##ople often found that news of wang ' s problems superseded their sales efforts .
` ` when they were making the decision , all hell broke loose with the finances . ' '
he says the lilly executives told him they could n ' t take the risk with wang .
mr . tai ##t say he does n ' t blame lilly .
buyers have to rely on a supplier ` ` continually upgrading and replacing the product , ' ' he says .
` ` when a company realizes that , it ' s hard to go with wang . ' '
he is now president of east ##ate homes inc . , an indianapolis contractor .
it can be hard for a sales ##person to fight off feelings of discourage ##ment .
brian pet ##re , a former wang salesman in upstate new york , says : ` ` you have pride in your job .
you think you can go out and turn things around .
it ' s a tough thing when you ca n ' t .
the reason does n ' t relate to your selling skills . ' '
one key for sales ##pe ##ople is to boost their own morale .
the good news is , it ' s not your fault . ' '
so , he advises , make goals ac ##hi ##eva ##ble .
but mr . miller , wang ' s new president , recently warned his sales ##pe ##ople about ne ##gat ##ivism .
` ` our customers watch us for the hidden message , ' ' he said .

` ` but it ' s not med ##io ##cre , it ' s a real problem . ' '

and the agency , which operated throughout fiscal 1989 with a $ 360 million budget short ##fall , has been under a hiring freeze since last fall .
the new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue .
the irs hopes to fill the new positions soon .

they were the signature of his adversary , panama ##nian leader manuel antonio nor ##ieg ##a .
he is now changing the place he sleeps every night , sometimes more than once a night .
his meals are most often prepared by women he trusts - - his full - time mistress , vicky ama ##do , and her mother , norma .
and he is collecting the names of those who telephone ##d the coup - makers to cong ##rat ##ulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters .
america ' s war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in february 1988 , is the legacy of that relationship .
for most of the past 30 years , the marriage was one of convenience .
but u . s . intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away .
mr . nor ##ieg ##a ' s tips on emerging leftist ##s at his school were deemed more important to u . s . interests .
from that point on , the u . s . would make a practice of overlooking the panama ##nian ' s mis ##ad ##vent ##ures .
the u . s . has befriended and later turned against many dictator ##s , but none quite so resource ##ful .
yet he has proved more res ##ili ##ent than any of them .
` ` the u . s . under ##est ##imated nor ##ieg ##a all along , ' ' says am ##bler moss , a former ambassador to panama .
` ` he has mastered the art of survival . ' '
` ` he is cornered , ' ' says the rev . fernando guard ##ia , who has led catholic church opposition against nor ##ieg ##a .
` ` the americans have left him without a way out .
it is easy to fight when you do n ' t have any other option . ' '
his chief advantage in the fight : his intimate knowledge of american ways and weaknesses .
born the illegitimate son of his father ' s maid , he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of panama city .
tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets , and gained admission to the academy because his brother had fa ##ls ##ified his birth certificate .
mr . nor ##ieg ##a ' s relationship to american intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967 , intelligence officials say .
united fruit was one of the two largest contributors to panama ' s national income .
satisfying its interests was a priority for any panama ##nian leader .
` ` he did it very well , ' ' recalls boris martinez , a former panama ##nian colonel who managed mr . nor ##ieg ##a and his operation .
` ` he started building the files that helped him gain power . ' '
by press ##uring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information .
he knew which local lu ##mina ##ries had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their mistress ##es .
this proved particularly valuable to the panama ##nian government in 1967 , when union leaders were planning a may day march that the government feared could turn violent .
mr . nor ##ieg ##a had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy .
the campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control .
` ` it was like a play on broadway , ' ' recalls mr . martinez .
` ` nor ##ieg ##a managed the whole thing .
nor ##ieg ##a was an expert at br ##ib ##ing and blackmail ##ing people . ' '
` ` people started wondering if something was wrong with him , ' ' mr . miranda recalls .
but through this period , so far as the u . s . military was concerned , mr . nor ##ieg ##a was a model recruit .
some american officers interpreted his eager ##ness and studio ##us ##ness as a sign of loyalty , but they did so falsely .
he became gen . tor ##ri ##jos ' s ins ##ep ##arable shadow , and the holder of all panama ' s secrets .
even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns .
during the nixon administration , the drug enforcement administration became dismay ##ed at the extent of the g - 2 ' s connections to arrested drug traffic ##kers .
one dea agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with col . nor ##ieg ##a , one of which was assassination .
the head of the dea at the time , john ing ##ers ##oll , scotch ##ed the assassination plan .
but he did fly to panama to sc ##old dictator tor ##ri ##jos on the drug ties of panama ##nian officials , including mr . nor ##ieg ##a .
mr . ing ##ers ##oll later recalled that gen . tor ##ri ##jos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the u . s . .
` ` everybody was afraid of him , ' ' mr . ing ##ers ##oll says .
the tapes included wire ##ta ##ps of gen . tor ##ri ##jos ' s own phone , according to american intelligence officials .
` ` we caught him with his hands on our cookie jar , ' ' says former cia director stan ##sfield turner .
` ` in the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from seed ##y characters .
the question is how much you get tied in with seed ##y characters so they can ex ##tort you . ' '
intelligence officials to this day worry whether mr . nor ##ieg ##a sold sensitive information on the recordings to the cuban ##s or others .
mr . turner was troubled enough to cancel the u . s . contract with the rent - a - colonel at the beginning of the carter administration .
the u . s . soon found new cause for concern : gun - running .
they included one of mr . nor ##ieg ##a ' s closest friends and business partners , carlos wit ##t ##gree ##n .
and the investigators were quickly closing in on mr . nor ##ieg ##a himself .
at the time , though , in 1979 , the u . s . was once again flirting with its longtime latin american spy .
mr . nor ##ieg ##a made plans to fly to washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the pentagon .
according to military officers at the time , word was passed to mr . nor ##ieg ##a by his american hosts that the police would be waiting .
on monday , u . s . officials received a routine , un ##class ##ified message from the military group commander in panama .
` ` due to health reasons , lt . col . nor ##ieg ##a has elected to post ##pone his visit to washington , ' ' it read .
panama ##nian dictator tor ##ri ##jos , he was told , had granted the shah of iran asylum in panama as a favor to washington .
mr . sanford was told mr . nor ##ieg ##a ' s friend , mr . wit ##t ##gree ##n , would be handling the shah ' s security .
it would n ' t be a good idea to ind ##ic ##t him - - much less mr . nor ##ieg ##a , the prosecutor was told .
after pro ##dding from mr . sanford , u . s . attorney jack es ##ken ##azi pleaded with justice department officials in washington to let the indictment proceed .
the letter , along with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the desk ##s of justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death .
` ` if he had been found guilty , we could have stopped him . ' '
soon , the military became a ve ##rita ##ble mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses .
the reagan administration also put mr . nor ##ieg ##a ' s g - 2 back on the u . s . payroll .
payments averaged nearly $ 200 , 000 a year from the u . s . defense intelligence agency and the cia .
although working for u . s . intelligence , mr . nor ##ieg ##a was hardly helping the u . s . exclusively .
during the reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the cuban ##s and the sand ##ini ##sta ##s .
mr . bland ##on says the general allowed the contra ##s to set up a secret training center in panama .
mr . nor ##ieg ##a also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the nicaragua ##n capital of mana ##gua .
and on at least one occasion , in the spring of 1985 , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a sand ##ini ##sta arsenal in nicaragua .
` ` nor ##ieg ##a played u . s . intelligence agencies and the u . s . government like a violin , ' ' he says .
mr . windsor notified everett e . briggs , the u . s . ambassador to panama , of the invitation .
` ` briggs screamed , ' ' mr . windsor recalls .
mr . briggs , on vacation after resigning his position at the national security council , could n ' t be reached for comment .
for instance , he helped steal the may 1984 panama ##nian elections for the ruling party .
and , all the while , panama ' s debt problems continued to grow .
in late 1986 , he made an offer he thought the u . s . could n ' t refuse .
mr . nor ##ieg ##a ' s proposal was turned down .
and mr . shu ##lt ##z curt ##ly told mr . abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his tar ##nished image .
within weeks the un ##folding iran - contra scandal took away mr . nor ##ieg ##a ' s insurance policy .
the death of cia director william casey and resignation of oliver north allowed anti - nor ##ieg ##a political forces to gain influence .
few american officials were willing any longer to defend him .
lawyers in miami - - this time working virtually without imp ##ed ##ime ##nt - - prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in february 1988 .
now , neither side - - the u . s . nor mr . nor ##ieg ##a - - has an easy out .
president bush has sworn to bring him to justice .
mr . nor ##ieg ##a believes he has n ' t any alternative but to continue clutching to power .
it is a knock - out battle - - perhaps to the death .
not quite , sen . leah ##y contend ##s .
` ` for short - term gains , people were willing to put up with him .
that allowed him to get stronger and stronger , ' ' he says .
yesterday ' s edition provided analysts ' estimates for the company when actual earnings were available .
industrial production declined 0 . 1 % in september , rein ##for ##cing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend .
` ` they need to do something about this , ' ' said ma ##ury harris , economist at pain ##ew ##eb ##ber group inc .
the fed also said u . s . industry operated at 83 . 6 % of capacity last month , down from 83 . 8 % in august .
measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures .
factory output dropped 0 . 2 % , its first decline since february , after having been unchanged in october .
factories operated at 83 . 7 % of capacity , the lowest rate in more than a year and down from 84 . 1 % in september .
the declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods , those intended to last more than three years .
the biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers , a category that includes the steel industry .
production of factory equipment , one indication of the strength of manufacturers ' investment spending , fell 0 . 3 % .
` ` whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soft ##en subsequently , ' ' mr . harris said .
` ` you have n ' t seen the full effect of that yet . ' '
a decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies , the fed noted .
analysts do n ' t expect the september surge in auto production to be repeated in the coming months .
here is a summary of the federal reserve board ' s report on industrial production in september .
william r . at ##tri ##dge resigned those posts , as well as a seat on nes ##b ' s board .
nes ##b is also the parent of om ##ni ##bank .
lung - cancer mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun to decline , federal researchers report .
the drop is particularly large for white males , although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates .
the national cancer institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart .
measured the same way , the decline for black males was 14 . 2 % .
the drop in mortality rates for women was less steep - - 8 . 9 % for blacks and 5 . 3 % for whites .
lung - cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over 55 , with sharp increases for everybody but white men .
however , he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking .
` ` smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population , especially children , adolescents and minorities . ' '
according to the american cancer society , smoking is responsible for 85 % of the lung - cancer cases among men and 75 % among women .
the nc ##i report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns .
a higher proportion of black men smoke than white men .
while nearly equal percentage ##s of black and white women currently smoke , in both sexes more whites have given up smoking than blacks .
in comparing changes in mortality rates over the past decade , the nc ##i study looked only at blacks and whites .
asian ##s and native americans were n ' t studied ; hispanic ##s were included with whites .
recent changes in average annual age - specific lung - cancer rates per 100 , 000 population by race and sex .

the action was confined to nas ##da ##q ' s biggest and most liquid stocks , traders said .

` ` the market must have turned up and down 15 different times , ' ' commented lance zipper , head of ot ##c trading at kidd ##er peabody .
` ` every time you thought it was going into a rally it gave up , and every time you thought it would rally it came down .
mr . zipper said the market is still settling down after the recent correction .
` ` everybody ' s confused and no one has an opinion that lasts longer than 30 seconds , ' ' said mr . zipper .
` ` a lot of the professional traders are just going back and forth .
william roth ##e , head of ot ##c trading at alex . brown & sons , in baltimore , said program trading is keeping the markets un ##sett ##led .

it started with improvements in hygiene made possible by affordable soap and wash ##able underwear during the industrial revolution .
then cast - iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed by sewage - and water - treatment plants toward the end of the 19th century .
medicine in the 19th century was dedicated mostly to combat ##ing sep ##sis and diagnostic analysis .
then the 20th century saw the evolution of private - sector wonder drugs , which prom ##ul ##gated medical therapy .
the process dramatically increased our average life expect ##ancy , eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well - being .
most public - health measures were handled at the local level .
new environmental ##ism probably started in 1962 with the publication of rachel carson ' s book ` ` silent spring . ' '
these apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such st ##al ##wart ##s as paul eh ##rl ##ich , barry common ##er , rene dubois and george wal ##d .
mr . eh ##rl ##ich predicted unprecedented famine by 1980 .
meanwhile , the new environmental ##ists systematically opposed the methods of the old environmental ##ists .
local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution .
new environmental ##ism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power .
let ' s rational ##ize our priorities by solving pollution problems at the local level as here ##to ##for ##e .
your story missed some essential points of the conference on ` ` the global environment : are we over ##rea ##cting ? ' '
first and foremost , the vi ##gne ##ttes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment .
the point was to answer the question in the conference title , not to try to create news stories for the event itself .
nor was it intended to di ##cta ##te a set of pre ##script ##ive solutions , although various points were raised .
each speaker was asked to address a specific topic , not deliver a point of view .
each scientist independently concluded society and government are under ##rea ##cting when it comes to substantive policy change .
this leads to a very special sense of urgency .
if the media decide to work harder at educating the public about these complex and technical issues , that hardly can be termed non - objective journalism .
the environment can no longer be a normal issue , to be dealt with on a business - as - usual basis with comfortable inc ##rem ##ents of change .
we have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet ' s atmosphere .
this porte ##nds consequences from what we have already done that will be very des ##ta ##bil ##izing to social and economic systems .
the consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes .

a company spokesman said yesterday that coca - cola enterprises sticks by its 1989 forecast .
third - quarter revenue was flat at $ 1 . 02 billion .
the year - ago results , however , included the operations of a bot ##tling business , which was sold last december .
excluding that bot ##tling business , coca - cola enterprises ' volume , measured by cases of soda , rose only 1 % .
the latest third - quarter volume also compares with a very strong 10 % growth in the year - ago quarter .
coca - cola enterprises blamed the lower volume on its soft - drink prices , which were about 3 % higher in the third quarter .
consumers have been accustomed to buying soft - drinks at discount ##ed prices for several years .
coca - cola enterprises said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping .
the company said it expects consumers will adjust to higher - priced soft drinks .
revenue was flat at about $ 2 . 97 billion .
sales rose 25 % to $ 3 . 90 billion from $ 3 . 13 billion .
the year - ago quarter ' s results include an after - tax charge of $ 5 . 9 million from the sale of a winery in spain .
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , coca - cola enterprises closed at $ 16 . 375 a share , down 62 . 5 cents .
pepsi ##co closed at $ 58 . 50 a share , up $ 1 . 375 .

at the time , the mer ##ks ##ame ##r chain had 11 stores in operation .
today , there are 77 units , all located in shopping malls .
the jewel ##ery chain was put up for sale in june .
according to those familiar with the situation , other bid ##ders included rat ##ners group plc of london and kay jewel ##ers inc .
first boston corp . is advising l . j . hooker on the sale of the mer ##ks ##ame ##r business .
mer ##ks ##ame ##r was the first in a series of retail acquisitions made by l . j . hooker .
the company was founded in sacramento in 1929 by two brothers , ralph and walter mer ##ks ##ame ##r , who operated as devon ' s jewel ##ers .
the sale of mer ##ks ##ame ##r jewel ##ers is subject to approval by judge tina bro ##zman of u . s . bankruptcy court .
the offer , which did n ' t include the mer ##ks ##ame ##r chain , is being reviewed by mr . si ##gol ##off .

the days may be numbered for animated shows featuring alf , the karate kid and the chip ##mun ##ks .
nbc ' s options could range from news - oriented programming to sports shows , although the network declined to comment .
the one - hour program will be repeated with updates throughout saturday mornings .
` ` we do n ' t need cartoons anymore .
they only accounted for 5 % , at best , of the station ' s total revenues . ' '
an nbc spokesman says the network will ` ` closely monitor ' ' the sacramento situation , and says it is the only station to defect .
the youthful audience for saturday programming is no longer dependent on the networks .
nbc has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a saturday version of ` ` today , ' ' which is produced by nbc news .
the network ' s own production company , nbc productions , supplies a half - hour family - oriented show titled ` ` saved by the bell . ' '
nbc productions or nbc news could supply the network with other saturday morning shows , a move that would control costs .
animated shows , which are made by outside production companies , cost the network about $ 300 , 000 per episode .
ro ##hm & haas co . said third - quarter net income ski ##dded 35 % to $ 32 . 6 million , or 49 cents a share .
in the year - earlier quarter , the chemicals company had net of $ 49 . 8 million , or 75 cents a share .
sales were $ 62 ##3 million , up 0 . 5 % from $ 61 ##9 . 8 million a year ago .
ro ##hm & haas , which plans to start operating seven new production units this year , attributed the profit slide partly to higher start - up expense .
the company also cited the stronger dollar , which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars .
inc ##rem ##ental ##ly higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs , such as overtime pay .
sales rose 5 . 2 % to $ 2 . 04 billion from $ 1 . 94 billion the previous year .
in new york stock exchange composite trading , ro ##hm & haas closed at $ 33 a share , down $ 1 . 75 .

he also held out little hope of rest ##it ##ution for purchase ##rs of $ 225 million in american continental subordinate ##d debt .

according to one person present at the meeting , eastern ' s new plan is financially ` ` overly optimistic . ' '
asked about the consultants ' reports , an eastern spoke ##sw ##oman said ` ` we totally disagree . ' '
she said they have ` ` overs ##im ##pl ##ified and made some er ##rone ##ous assumptions that make their analysis completely off - base . ' '
he insisted , as he has before , that creditors would be paid in full under the plan .
mr . lorenzo made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan .
` ` we ' re meeting and surpassing our goals , ' ' he added .
but after selling off pieces such as its east coast shuttle , its philadelphia hub and various planes , eastern hit a stumbling block .
it could n ' t sell its south american routes , one of the major assets marked for disposal .
those routes , valued by the creditors ' professionals at about $ 400 million , were to be sold to am ##r corp . ' s american airlines .
eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself , which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization .
it also would leave eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled - down one proposed under the initial plan .
those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be rev ##amp ##ed .
since then , eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions , but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions .
the committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze eastern ' s plans .
both said the new plan would n ' t work .
experts from goldman sachs estimated eastern would miss the same mark by $ 120 million to $ 135 million , the source said .
the experts said they expected eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated .
other costs also would increase , including maintenance , because eastern has an older fleet .
at the news conference , mr . lorenzo and eastern president phil ba ##kes presented a far rosie ##r assessment .
starting next month , eastern will begin flying 77 ##5 flights daily instead of the previously announced 700 , they said .
these accounts hold several hundred million dollars , primarily from asset sales .
the plan eastern hopes to pursue , he said , calls for eastern to have $ 390 million in cash by year ' s end .
both he and mr . lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in january .
however , he added , ` ` it ' s not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors .
it must be accepted by the court . ' '
under bankruptcy law , eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan .
that deadline has been extended once and could be extended again .
if eastern can get credit ##or support , court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift .
but creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan , or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own .
in any event , some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by january as forecast by mr . lorenzo and mr . ba ##kes .
eastern sought bankruptcy - law protection a few days after a cr ##ip ##pling strike began march 4 .
mr . lorenzo told reporters the reorganization eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85 % to 90 % of the size of the pre - bankruptcy eastern .
hopes of sim ##plify ##ing the corporate minimum tax before 1990 are weakening .

kay peterson mounts her bicycle and grind ##s up yet another steep , rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain goats .
` ` this , ' ' says ms . peterson , ` ` is what it ' s all about . ' '
the animal had to be destroyed ; the biker ##s fled and were never found .
in numerous parks near san francisco , rangers have been forced to close trails , set up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding .
they have even sent helicopters in pursuit of biker ##s after hike ##rs and equestrian ##s complained they were being driven from trails .
` ` we were being overrun , ' ' says steve fia ##la , trails coordinator of the east bay regional park district .
two years ago , the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its 65 , 000 hilly acres .
from about 200 , 000 six years ago , the number of mountain bikes in the u . s . is expected to grow to 10 million in 1990 .
at least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone .
key to the issue is that the bikes , in skill ##ful hands , can go virtually anywhere , and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror .
an adept bi ##cy ##cl ##ist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance .
for ha ##rrie ##d public - land managers across the nation , the response is increasingly to shut the gates .
the state of california , following the lead of some regional parks , recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles .
the move largely con ##si ##gn ##s them to roads used by motorized vehicles .
the bikes are un ##we ##lco ##me on trails in national parks .
often these closing ##s come after vigorous anti - bike lobbying by conservation organizations , the politically potent sierra club among them .
sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the california ban ##s .
mr . lang ##ton is among the legions of biker ##s who got their first taste of wilderness as hike ##rs or backpack ##ers .
even staunch anti - bike sierra members con ##cede that 10 % of all riders cause most of the problems .
` ` i think we ' re making progress . ' '
they wanted a machine that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles .
they got a machine more responsive , more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the thin - tired racing bikes that then were the rage .
when the bikes first entered mass production in 1981 , they were dismissed as a fa ##d .
last year , 25 % of the 10 million bicycles sold in the u . s . were mountain bikes .
in california , a bell ##we ##ther market , they accounted for more than 80 % of all bike sales .
the majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country .
city dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic , bounce easily over curb ##s and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes .
crested butte , population 1 , 200 , is a bastion of the sport .
by one estimate , everyone here under 50 owns at least one bike .
the town is home to the mountain bike hall of fame and it hosts the annual fat tire bike week .
this summer , the jam ##bor ##ee attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town ' s winter ski season .
david lindsey , chairman of the fat tire bike celebration , muse ##s that the bike ' s popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia .

that cut short the rally in treasury bonds and depressed prices moderately below late monday ' s levels .

the fed has allowed a key short - term interest rate to decline about one - quarter percentage point .

in the 1988 third quarter , the forest - products company reported profit of $ 144 . 9 million , or 69 cents a share .
sales rose 9 % to $ 2 . 57 billion from $ 2 . 36 billion .
sales rose 9 % to $ 7 . 54 billion from $ 6 . 95 billion .
forest - products operations strengthened in the third quarter , while paper operations were dogg ##ed by higher costs , soft news ##print exports and a strong japanese yen .
some competing forest - products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business .
looking ahead to the fourth quarter , the company said export log and lumber markets will be weak , while panel and pl ##ywood markets will be stronger .
pulp and paper performance depends on cost and price variables , the company said .
the bank also said it expects to report a $ 1 . 42 billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year .
` ` step up to the plate and take the big swing .
bankers trust ` ` has had the capacity to do this for some time , ' ' the analyst said .
he expects ci ##tic ##or ##p to take a similar step this year .
three other major u . s . banks posted earnings increases .
wells fargo & co . of san francisco posted a 17 % jump .
analysts were only slightly disappointed by ci ##tic ##or ##p ' s numbers .
earnings from the bank ' s global consumer business grew 27 % .
` ` the consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream , ' ' said mr . mc ##dermott of ke ##efe , br ##uy ##ette & woods .
overall , the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $ 70 million from $ 80 million a year earlier .
ci ##tic ##or ##p ' s spokesman said , however , that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth .
wells fargo ' s return on equity increased to 24 . 4 % from 23 . 8 % .
but the amount was still 39 % higher than the year - ago level , and 25 % higher as a percentage of total loans .
the comparable year - earlier number was $ 56 million , a spokesman said .
fees from syn ##dic ##ating loans dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million .
expenses unrelated to interest rose 5 . 4 % , to $ 54 ##1 million .

other analysts say the indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties .
elections in this large , diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict .
much depends on the opposition , a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former gandhi cabinet minister vis ##hwa ##nath pr ##ata ##p singh .
the elections will be held in different states on one of the two days .
his early promises to make india a modern nation remain bog ##ged down in b ##lo ##ated bureaucracy .
his pledge to clean up local administration and indian politics , including his own party , went un ##ful ##fi ##lled .
his ` ` mr . clean ' ' image was mud ##die ##d by an arms - kick ##back scandal , which will be a major campaign issue .
some analysts predict that disappointment in mr . gandhi ' s spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy - handed local government will crest at the polls .
` ` i think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman , by a corrupt revenue collector .
this could be a big protest against an administrative failure . ' '
the lok sabha , or lower house of parliament , has 54 ##2 elected and two appointed seats .
in 1984 , the congress - l ##rb - i - rr ##b - captured 405 seats , the largest victory in the history of indian democracy .
the landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in india at the time .
mrs . gandhi had been assassinated by sep ##arat ##ist sikhs , and many indians feared their country might split apart .
in the previous three general elections , similar national issues clinched the vote .
in 1971 , the congress party won after india ' s victory in the bangladesh war .
but if the opposition remains fractured , the congress - l ##rb - i - rr ##b - could win a small majority , or lead a coalition government .
analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to unite , and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates .
the contract was negotiated by the countries ' two prime ministers , and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs .
in april 1987 , evidence surfaced that commissions were paid .
the opposition charged that the money was used to bribe indian government officials , an all ##ega ##tion denied by mr . gandhi ' s administration .
but many of his statements on the issue in parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence .
it was the first time in 20 years that such government bills were defeated .
his term has produced no spectacular failures in politics , in the economy or on the military front , and has chalk ##ed up some successes .
but the average indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt .
his failures in those two areas deeply , and sometimes bitterly , disappointed many indians .
` ` the congress government is taking the farmers ' bread and not giving us any support .
when there are well problems , light problems , road problems , the government tells us to forget it . ' '
the greatest thing going for mr . gandhi and the congress - l ##rb - i - rr ##b - party is the poor reputation of the opposition .
even if it unite ##s for the elections , its co ##her ##ence is likely to be temporary .

the inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices .
but bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the ji ##tter ##y stock market .
in early trading , investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that friday ' s stock market de ##ba ##cle would be repeated .

the settlement prices of the december , february and april gold contracts were even with monday ' s final prices .
the december 1989 contract , which has the greatest trading volume , ended at $ 37 ##1 . 20 an ounce .
the other months posted advances of 10 cents to 20 cents an ounce .
` ` producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold . ' '
jeffrey nichols , president of ap ##ms canada , toronto precious metals advisers , said there is little to mo ##tiv ##ate gold traders to buy the metal .
there is n ' t any rush on the part of investors in the west to buy gold , he said .
` ` it ' s an experience they do n ' t want to repeat . ' '
there is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher , it may be just a false alarm .
this is keeping the gold traders hand ##cu ##ffed . ' '
previously , he noted , gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market , letting prices rise as much as possible before selling .
` ` the dollar has n ' t reacted much to it , so gold has n ' t either , ' ' he said .
crude oil prices rose slightly in lack ##lus ##ter activity as traders in the pits tried to assess action in the stock market .
since stock market index ##es plum ##met ##ed last friday , participants in all markets have been wary .
when traders become confident that the stock market has stabilized , oil prices are expected to rise as supply and demand fundamental ##s once again become the major consideration .

futures prices rose on a report that cuba may seek to post ##pone some sugar shipments .
the march contract advanced 0 . 14 cent a pound to 14 . 11 cents .
` ` japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar , ' ' the analyst said .
it was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices , the analyst said .
another analyst noted that cuba has been def ##er ##ring shipments in recent years .
` ` to the professionals in the trade it did n ' t cause much surprise .
the march futures contract traded as high as 14 . 24 cents , but could n ' t sustain the advance , ' ' he said .

the nations of southern africa know a lot about managing elephants ; their herds are thriving .
but the nations of europe and north america have decided they know better .
at this week ' s u . n . conference in lausanne , they imposed a global ivory ban that seeks to over ##turn local policies .
a zimbabwe ##an delegate argued that the ban would ` ` guarantee the extinction of the elephant . ' '
legitimate ranch ##ers , who have an interest in preserving the herds , would go out of business .
many delegates were willing to craft a compromise , but u . s . delegate constance ha ##rri ##man and others thunder ##ed that down .
the greens from the first world wanted a morality play , not a negotiation .
fortunately , the nations of southern africa have n ' t totally surrendered their sovereignty .
five countries announced they would not honor what one zimbabwe ##an delegate wryly called the ` ` made in switzerland ' ' solution .

health benefits remain a central lobbying effort , even as section 89 fades .
and the group will urge that the federal government pre - em ##pt state rules on what must be covered by employers ' health insurance .
small - business groups also will fight the medical - leave provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves .
there is also worry that the pepper commission studying long - term health care will again push law ##makers toward employer ##pa ##id solutions .
the section 89 victory could have a downs ##ide by making it harder to oppose law ##makers on other health proposals .

it was ` ` the soviets ' vietnam . ' '
but there never was a chance that the afghan resistance would overthrow the kabul regime quickly and easily .
soviet leaders said they would support their kabul clients by all means necessary - - and did .
the u . s . said it would fully support the resistance - - and did n ' t .
with the february 1987 u . n . accord ##s ` ` relating to afghanistan , ' ' the soviet union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control .
but as soon as the accord ##s were signed , american officials sharply reduced aid .
in february 1989 , when the soviets said they had completed their pull ##out , the u . s . cut it further .
gen . gr ##omo ##v himself said soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $ 1 billion of military equipment and installations for the kabul regime .
by early may , moscow had delivered , for example , 1 , 000 trucks , about 100 tanks , artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles .
moscow claims this is all needed to protect the kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance .
it is well - known that the regular afghan infantry is filled with reluctant con ##script ##s .
but this is not the entire afghan army , and it is no longer kabul ' s only military force .
even if not all these forces are committed to the regime , they are now dependent on it .
and thousands of afghan children have been taken to the soviet union , where they are hostage for the behavior of their families .
since 1981 , indian military advisers have been assisting the kabul regime .
cuban military personnel also have been active in afghanistan since 1979 .
the soviets cut a deal with iran : a future iranian role in afghanistan in exchange for iranian support of soviet policy .
the deal was symbol ##ized by the restoration of the shi ' it ##e sultan ali ke ##sh ##tman ##d to the afghan prime ministry .
moreover , serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of soviet forces .
meanwhile , the kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody - minded fan ##atics .
this heavy outside support for the worst has undermine ##d better , moderate leaders .
in autumn last year , for example , the regime garrison at kan ##dah ##ar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderate ##s .
the deal fell through , and kan ##dah ##ar remains a major regime base .
the resistance lacks not only air power , armor and expertise but often such essential ##s as maps , mine detectors , or even winter gloves .
experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime .
instead , they were pressured by pakistan ' s is ##i , the channel for their support , into attacking ja ##lal ##abad .
they took more than 25 % casualties ; journalists report that they faced mine ##fields without mine detectors .
the wonder is not that the resistance has failed to top ##ple the kabul regime , but that it continues to exist and fight at all .
for months the resistance has been defense ##less against air attack .
thus far there is no indication that they have been re - supplied with sting ##ers or other anti - aircraft weapons .
moscow and kabul must have found that information useful .
no settlement negotiated by others can force the afghan people to give up their struggle .
a cut ##off of u . s . military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain .
creation of a new , realistic u . s . policy is long over ##due .
yet under mr . reagan ' s preferred successor , president bush , those two cher ##ished national - security causes are with ##ering on the vine .
` ` the programs have arthritis , ' ' says rep . henry hyde , a conservative republican from illinois .
yet , he asserts , ` ` you look around . . . and you say , ` who are the leaders ?
who is going to carry the water ? ' ' '
it is n ' t surprising that president bush has n ' t led a crusade to pump up the contra ##s or sd ##i .
though he nominally supports both programs , mr . bush has n ' t been a passionate champion of either cause , as mr . reagan was .
` ` but it ' s like kicking your father in the pants .
you hate to do it because he ' s your father . ' '
of course , neither president bush nor the congress has actually abandoned the contra ##s or sd ##i .
mr . bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide non ##let ##hal aid to the contra ##s until nicaragua holds national elections next february .
but the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels .
but the strong pitch by mr . cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to sd ##i .
the soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space - based defenses .
some activists are to ##iling to raise the profile of the two causes .
but they say they ca n ' t make much head ##way because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide .
one longtime champion of these programs in congress , republican whip newt gin ##gr ##ich of georgia , is distracted by questions about his ethics , conservatives note .
above all , though , proponents say neither the contra nor the sd ##i cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support .
all this causes rep . hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm .
we ' re sorry to report that on monday president bush accepted the resignation of william allen as chairman of the u . s . civil rights commission .
mr . allen , appointed by president reagan , grew understand ##ably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies .
mr . allen ' s commissioners voted to call his un ##rea ##d speech ` ` thought ##less , disgusting and un ##ne ##ces ##sari ##ly inflammatory . ' '
commissioner mary francis berry said it was ` ` another sad episode in the saga of the un ##guide ##d missile who is chairman . ' '
thomas st ##od ##dar ##d , head of the lambda legal defense fund , called the prospect of the speech ` ` frankly shocking . ' '
mr . allen began it with a warning to his hosts , a california church group that opposes rights for homosexual ##s .
he says the title of his speech was to make his point that americans have rights as individuals , not as members of certain select groups .
this hardly sounds like an anti - homosexual sc ##ree ##d .
the three most important things to understand about mr . allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual - - a triple threat to the liberal establishment .
he last made waves when he dared to defend an indian girl who had been adopted by non - indian parents off her reservation .
indeed , the gap is so large that mr . allen ' s critics refuse to engage the debate .
their rid ##ic ##ule of him is no substitute for argument .
their effort to run him out of washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement .
we hope the next head of the civil rights commission will be as brave as mr . allen in making the case for equality of civil rights .

and those swings pale ##d beside friday ' s 190 . 58 - point plunge and monday ' s 88 . 12 - point recovery .
and , apparently , it is here to stay .
but most are linked by a single theme : liquid ##ity - - the ability to get in and out of the market quickly .
prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways to turn over shares at ever - faster rates and increasingly acting in concert .
` ` institutions are herd ##ing animals , ' ' says peter anderson , who heads the pension - fund management arm of id ##s financial services inc .
` ` we watch the same indicators and listen to the same pro ##gno ##stic ##ators .
like le ##mming ##s , we tend to move in the same direction at same time . ' '
and that , naturally , ex ##ace ##rba ##tes price movements .
institutions - - who now account for most trading - - count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an eye - blink .
but when they discover that markets are n ' t always as liquid as they supposed - - markets jump .
and when many firms had to ` ` pay up , ' ' monday ' s sudden rally was sparked .
trading in futures and options , some people believe , can add to vol ##ati ##lity .
one new investment style called ` ` asset allocation ' ' shifts portfolio weight ##ings between stocks , bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive .
it added another 5 % monday before stocks rallied .
when they did , the firm reduced those stock holdings to about 70 % .
a classic example of institutions ' hunger for liquid ##ity is portfolio insurance , now widely disc ##red ##ited .
before the 1987 crash , an estimated $ 60 billion in institutional money was managed under this he ##d ##ging technique .
but in october 1987 , when portfolio ins ##urer ##s rushed to sell at the same time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets .
yet even today , institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fr ##o in the markets .
others are doing ` ` index ar ##bit ##rage ' ' a strategy of taking advantage of price disc ##re ##pan ##cies between stocks and futures .
but institutions say wall street broker ##age firms are less willing to make markets .
` ` i think everyone ' s a little more lee ##ry , ' ' says jack baker , head of equity trading at shear ##on lehman hutton inc .
` ` why should i risk money for a guy for who ' s paying me five cents a dance ?
lack of liquid ##ity can also result from exchange ` ` reforms . ' '
the circuit breakers caused a 30 - minute shut ##down in trading in standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index futures contract as the markets were falling .
` ` with the futures - trading halt , you could only sell stocks ' ' to cut exposure to the market , says a money manager .
` ` it was scary to people thinking that they could n ' t get their trades off . ' '
` ` then they said , ` by the way , two of the doors are locked . ' ' '
the takeover mania also adds to vol ##ati ##lity .
valued as a buy - out target , the airline stock was trading at nearly $ 280 a share .
when the deal ran into trouble , the stock tumbled ; it closed at $ 198 yesterday .
presumably , ua ##l is now trading closer to its value based on earnings .
by contrast , traditional buy - and - hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves .
some experts say markets are n ' t as volatile as widely assumed .
` ` i just ca n ' t believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this vol ##ati ##lity , ' ' he says .
some people tend to ignore that a 50 - point move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower .
some people think the search for liquid ##ity is fruit ##less .
he estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to ex ##pu ##nge the virus from a computer system .
in the ling ##o of computer security , the nasa intruder is technically a computer worm , mr . red ##mond said .
a worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks .
the galileo worm apparently was hatch ##ed on a computer in france hooked up to nasa ' s space physics analysis network , mr . red ##mond said .
nasa said the galileo worm had n ' t affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms .
but mr . red ##mond said the worm hit universities that had n ' t elected to make the changes .
you talk of times of peace for all , and then prepare for war . ' '
the worm also looks for elementary password ##s that con ##fer more privileges on the user .
the password ##s are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running .
nasa estimated that , on monday , about four computer centers were affected .
yesterday , the number grew to 40 ; today the number is expected to grow to 100 .
anti - nuclear activists have protested the launch of the galileo space probe to jupiter because it uses pluto ##nium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft .
nasa said the galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay .
mr . alexander of computer ##world said hacker ##s have gone after span before .
yet it is also ax ##iom ##atic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts .
in practice , however , the line between interpretation and red ##ef ##ini ##tion of the criminal law long ago began to blur .
in particular , a common law of white - collar crime has developed with surprising rapid ##ity over the past decade .
for example , although insider trading has long been criminal , it has never been stat ##uto ##rily defined .
gradually , however , lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point .
consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of robert chest ##man .
basically , mr . chest ##man was a fourth - level tip ##pee .
did mr . lo ##eb seek personal gain - l ##rb - and if so , how - rr ##b - ?
or did mr . chest ##man only hear a market rumor - l ##rb - which one may lawful ##ly trade upon - rr ##b - ?
the line seems awful ##ly thin for criminal - law purposes .
a second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by robert freeman , formerly head of ar ##bit ##rage at goldman , sachs & co .
the illegal ` ` tip ' ' of the bunny ' s good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market .
had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced :
was there a fi ##du ##cia ##ry breach in order to obtain personal gain ?
yet , all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue : who is and who should be making the criminal law here ?
it is not my contention that either mr . chest ##man or mr . freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutor ##ial over ##ze ##alo ##us ##ness .
arguably , both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky .
courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors .
after - the - fact judicial examination of an actor ' s conduct has always been the common law ' s method .
when only civil liability is involved , this method has the und ##enia ##ble strengths of factual specific ##ity and avoidance of over ##gen ##eral ##ization .
thus , a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule .
can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly imp ##ro ##ba ##ble rumor is in fact false ?
today , after mr . freeman ' s plea , there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt .
at least when the stakes are high , uncertainty in turn results in over ##in ##cl ##usion , as individuals do not dare to approach an uncertain line closely .
the federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white - collar crime .
we are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative give ##away .
predict ##ably , when confronted with morally dubious behavior , prosecutors will exploit the latitude such open ##ended statutes give them .
over the long run , however , sl ##ea ##zy cases will make bad law .

the year - earlier figure included a one - time gain of $ 59 . 9 million from the sale of corn ##ing ' s stakes in japanese businesses .

sales rose 14 % to $ 71 ##5 million from $ 625 . 4 million .
but the specialty - material segment slowed somewhat and consumer products continued below expectations .

some bankers are reporting more inquiries than usual about cds since friday .
chemical said deposits monday were about $ 5 million higher than usual and it expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds from sales of stock .
` ` this is no time to be playing in the street . . .
some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term cds in the latest week .
on average , however , three - month cds at major banks are yielding a tenth of a percentage point less than they were a week ago .
average yields on cds aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on treasury bills sold at monday ' s auction .
the yield on six - month t - bills fell to 7 . 82 % on monday , from 8 . 01 % the week before .
cds sold by major broker ##age houses , which like ju ##mbo cds tend to closely follow interest rate trends , also posted larger drops in yields .
cd yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks .
conservatives have an important decision to make this fall .
the im ##f has several reasons for requesting the increase .
its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s .
the size and pace of di ##sb ##urse ##ments will accelerate further under the brady plan , which promises larger and earlier di ##sb ##urse ##ments to approved countries .
at least three other factors have encouraged the im ##f to insist on increased capital .
first , it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets , for which it feels some responsibility .
third , the im ##f would like to meet japan ' s request for increased ownership - l ##rb - currently 4 . 5 % - rr ##b - .
while international politics may argue for the capital increase , there is a clear economic case against it .
opponents of the increase argue that the im ##f practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments .
they question whether the im ##f has any role in developing countries , given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in balance - of - payments emergencies .
opponents show that there are already more funds available than com ##men ##dable reform efforts .
they point at the numerous developing - country governments that have inflated , tax ##ed and regulated themselves into despair under successive im ##f programs .
decisions on increases in the im ##f ' s capital base traditionally are made by the administration , with subsequent authorization by congress .
the politics of the 1990 congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorization ##s .
conservative republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party ' s popular president in an election year .
commentators would fr ##et over the implications for the g - 7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets .
on the other hand , a decision to increase the im ##f ' s capital would reinforce the central economic role of multi ##lateral institutions in developing countries .
up ##ping the ant ##e could slow economic development even further , as countries delay market - opening steps in anticipation of richer multi ##lateral support .
conservatives should take a position prior to the administration ' s year - end deadline .
the issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase , rather than its purpose .
mr . mal ##pass directs the republican staff of the joint economic committee of congress .

sp ##ook ##ed investors , despite their stampede to dump takeover stocks , should hold on tight to their jaguar shares .
yesterday , ford motor disclosed that it has raised its holding in jaguar to 10 . 4 % from 5 % .
both ford and its rival general motors recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the british company .
ford ' s latest move increases the pressure on gm to complete its current talks with jaguar quickly .
gm is likely to reach the cooperative operating pact it has been seeking in about two weeks , knowledge ##able individuals say .
at that point investors may face a long , bump ##y ride .
a victor in the fight for jaguar may not emerge until after the ex ##piration late next year of british government takeover restrictions .
the curb ##s prevent a buyer from purchasing more than 15 % of jaguar shares without permission .
` ` this is an exceptionally odd takeover battle , ' ' says london analyst christopher will of shear ##son lehman hutton .
jaguar ' s american deposit ##ary receipts were up 3 \ / 8 yesterday in a down market , closing at 10 3 \ / 8 .
jaguar topped the most - active list for the u . s . over - the - counter market monday .
and on london ' s stock exchange monday , 18 . 5 million shares were traded , far above the usual volume .
ford ' s share purchases undoubtedly accounted for much of monday ' s heavy trading .
last week , many jaguar shareholders took their money and ran .
fears that ford ' s ar ##dor might be cooling put jaguar shares into reverse after gm confirmed its friendly negotiations with jaguar .
but yesterday ' s announcement indicates that ford has n ' t lost interest .
but a crucial point is how ford reacts when gm , the world ' s largest auto maker , firms up its proposed deal with jaguar .
at the moment , ford executives will say little beyond rei ##tera ##ting their desire to raise ford ' s jaguar stake to about 15 % .
analysts believe the car makers also will create joint ventures to develop new executive models , doubling jaguar ' s yearly output of 50 , 000 cars .
jaguar shareholders would have to bless such a far - reaching accord .
ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the u . k . government agreed to drop the anti - takeover barrier early .
` ` i think ford is going to come out with full guns blazing , ' ' mr . rei ##tman says .
` ` ford wants - lc ##b - jaguar - rc ##b - very much . ' '
then , mr . will says , ` ` you get a bidding war between two very rich , very determined international companies . ' '
at the moment , he intends to keep the firm ' s 180 , 000 jaguar shares .
the risk is that jaguar ' s share price could slump if gm ' s agreement with jaguar effectively locks out its u . s . rival .
` ` i thought the pro ##ba ##bilities of - lc ##b - a bidding war - rc ##b - happening were less , ' ' he says .
of course , that was before ford ' s latest move .

consumers may want to move their telephone ##s a little closer to the tv set .
two weeks ago , viewers of several nbc daytime consumer segments started calling a 900 number for advice on various life - style issues .
interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in so ##phi ##stic ##ation , and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities .
eventually viewers may grow bored with the technology and res ##ent the cost .

right away you notice the following things about a philip glass concert .
people in glass houses tend to look stone ##d .
either one likes it or one does n ' t .
the typical glass audience , which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers , certainly does .
the work , though , sounds like mu ##zak for spaceship ##s .
philip glass is the emperor , and his music the new clothes , of the avant - garde .
softly introducing and explaining his pieces , mr . glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital .
it is music for people who want to hear something different but do n ' t want to work especially hard at the task .
it is e - z listening for the now generation .
mr . glass has inverted the famous modernist di ##ctum ` ` less is more . ' '
but the music has its charm , and mr . glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex .
there is a recognizable musical style here , but not a particular performance style .
the music is not especially pianist ##ic ; indeed , it ' s hard to imagine a bad performance of it .
nothing bra ##vu ##ra , no ar ##pe ##ggio ##s , no tick ##lish finger ##ing problems challenge the performer .

so why did advertising pages plunge by almost 10 % and ad revenue by 7 . 2 % in the first half ?
to hear ad ##vert ##iser ##s tell it , the magazine just has n ' t kept up with the times .
worse , it la ##gged behind competitors in offering now - standard gi ##mm ##ick ##s , from regional editions to discount ##s for frequent ad ##vert ##iser ##s .
but now , the magazine is attempting to fight back , with an ambitious plan including a rev ##amp ##ed sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign .
ad ##vert ##iser ##s do n ' t think of the magazine first , says joan mcc ##ra ##w , who joined in april as national advertising director .
` ` what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance .
people did n ' t believe we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many ways we were n ' t . ' '
the 101 - year - old magazine has never had to woo ad ##vert ##iser ##s with quite so much fe ##r ##vor before .
the magazine had its best year yet in 1988 , when it celebrated its centennial and rack ##ed up a 17 % gain in ad pages , to 283 .
but this year , when the hull ##aba ##lo ##o surrounding its centennial died , so too did some ad ##vert ##iser interest .
but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions , and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors .
time magazine , for example , has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions , top management , and other groups .
and national geographic ' s smaller - than - average size means extra production costs for ad ##vert ##iser ##s .
but ms . mcc ##ra ##w says the magazine is fighting back .
it now offers 30 regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beef ##ing up its sales force .
and it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives , marketing directors , and media executives just that .
her goal : to top 300 ad pages in 1990 , up from about 274 this year .
whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain .
` ` the ad campaign is meant to con ##tem ##por ##ize the thought of national geographic , ' ' she says .

the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges , a move almost certain to in ##fur ##iate exchange officials and traders .
dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers .
the issue exploded this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange .
while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations .
critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders .
traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders .
the exchanges say liquid ##ity becomes a severe problem for thin ##ly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before ex ##piration .
the cf ##tc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions .
members of congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to re ##au ##thor ##ize cf ##tc operations .
so far , one test of restricting dual trading has worked well .
the chicago mer ##c banned dual trading in its standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index futures pit in 1987 .
under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers .
traders who stand on the pit ' s top step , where most customer orders are executed , ca n ' t trade for themselves .
a mer ##c spokesman said the plan has n ' t made much difference in liquid ##ity in the pit .
` ` it ' s too soon to tell . . . but people do n ' t seem to be unhappy with it , ' ' he said .
he said he would n ' t comment on the cf ##tc plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal .
japanese luxury - car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealers ##hips .
but some dealers are negotiating loose ##r terms , while others decline to deal at all .
nissan motor co . ' s in ##fin ##iti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and fur ##nish a building in a japanese style .
specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each show ##room and a tile bridge spanning a stream that flows into the building from outside .
toyota motor corp . ' s lex ##us division also provides specifications .
but only two - thirds of lex ##us dealers are constructing new buildings according to the lex ##us spec ##s .
some are even coming up with their own novel designs .
in louisville , ky . , for example , david peterson has built a lex ##us dealers ##hip with the show ##room on the second floor .
yet some dealers have turned down in ##fin ##iti or lex ##us franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements .
mr . se ##id ##man says he turned down a lex ##us franchise in part because ` ` the building was gorgeous but very expensive . ' '
to head off arguments , in ##fin ##iti offers dealers cash bonuses and low - interest construction loans .
di ##cta ##tion device ' s saga plays back a lesson
products don ' t have to be first to be winners .
that ' s the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit .
marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pic ##o project .
di ##cta ##phone went ahead and introduced the pic ##o in 1985 , but it has n ' t sold well .
to date , says emil ja ##chman ##n , a di ##cta ##phone vice president , it has ` ` broken even or shown a small loss . ' '
nevertheless , the device has been successful in other ways .
it helped di ##cta ##phone attract better engineers , and it provided new technology for other company products .
the pic ##oca ##sse ##tte recorder also helped transform the company ' s reputation from follower to leading - edge inn ##ova ##tor .
the studies are on exhibit at harvard this month and will travel to chicago ' s institute of design and the university of california at berkeley .
one day carl barrett of mobile , ala . , was ra ##king some sy ##cam ##ore leaves , but the rake kept riding up over the piles .

the ghosts of the past are everywhere : they are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget .
those obsolete operations cost less than $ 2 billion a year , and keep mac ' s ghost quiet .
that ' s about all it costs to app ##ease ad ##m . erich rae ##der ' s ghost .
in 1941 , rae ##der and the german navy threatened to attack the panama canal , so we created the southern command in panama .
the southern command has grown even bigger since the war because rae ##der ' s ghost sometimes runs through the e ring dressed like gen . nor ##ieg ##a .
the brigade has n ' t been heard from since , but we keep the staff around just in case .
george marshall ' s ghost is much more difficult to keep happy .
we keep a lot of shrines to him around the pentagon : statues , bust ##s , relics and such .
now his ghost wo n ' t let up till it ' s done .
which brings up the worst and mean ##est ghost of all - - the ghost of the shah of iran .
mr . carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab iran .
but that ghost would n ' t settle for words , he wanted money and people - - lots .
so mr . carter formed three new army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in tampa called the rapid deployment force .
after mr . carter was defeated in 1980 , the shah ' s ghost claimed the credit and then went after president reagan and cap wei ##nberger .
i saw what he did to them first ##hand .
it made my shoe ##lace ##s dance with terror .
he dedicated all these new forces to the persian gulf .
one night both marshall ' s ghost and the shah ' s ghost together caught cap and threw him to the ground .
before they let him go he added a thousand bureau ##crats to the rd ##f in tampa and renamed it central command .
he gave those bureau ##crats charge of all naval operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean .
marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers - - someday maybe they would get the whole navy .
they had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweep ##ers .
we ' d get our ass ##es kicked . ' '
lucky for cap , ike was easy ##going and soon went away , while the shah - - he kept coming back .
- l ##rb - but who ' s counting . - rr ##b -
still , berber ##a was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with president barr ##ah .
all these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway .
meanwhile , congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget .
could n ' t we save $ 20 billion or $ 30 billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves ?
and where were all our handsome ##ly paid indian ocean allies last year when our convoys were being attacked ? ' '
questions like that really stir up marshall ' s ghost .
he appeared late one night in the bedroom of the new defense secretary , dick cheney .
marshall came clan ##king in like marley ' s ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with arab des ##pot ##s .
he would n ' t leave until mr . cheney promised to do whatever the pentagon systems analysts told him .
so next day mr . cheney went out and did just that : he canceled the 600 - ship navy and cut back one carrier and 20 frigates .
then he canceled production of the navy ' s most important carrier aircraft , the f - 14 and the a - 6 .
on the other hand , mr . cheney retained all those new land forces .
marshall ' s ghost is satisfied for now , but he ' ll be back .
what with halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming , more and more pentagon bureau ##crats are crawling under their desk ##s .
they know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships .

the metal and marble lobby of cent ##rus ##t bank ' s headquarters is grande ##r than your average savings and loan .
cent ##rus ##t did n ' t meet the deadline .
last spring , the com ##pt ##roller ' s office called a halt to mr . paul ' s fling , giving him six months to sell the paintings .
the acquisitions , officials said in a letter to mr . paul , were ` ` unsafe , un ##so ##und and unauthorized . ' '
so far , mr . paul has un ##loaded but three of his masterpiece ##s , he wo n ' t say to whom .
the com ##pt ##roller ' s office says it is ` ` monitoring the situation . ' '
though the agency could remove mr . paul , it has no current intention to do that .
` ` the last six months has established the quality of the collection .
there ' s no fire sale here . ' '
there , on one of his first shopping trips , mr . paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices .
the price paid was a record for the artist .
- l ##rb - some 64 % of items offered at the gut ##erman auction were sold , at an average price of $ 343 , 333 .
the rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids . - rr ##b -
` ` he says he ` stole them , ' ' ' recalls mr . gut ##erman .
mr . paul denies ph ##oning and g ##lo ##ating .
` ` it ' s just not true , ' ' he says .
mr . wa ##cht ##er , who became his principal adviser , searched galleries in london , paris and monaco .
mr . hall says mr . paul ` ` was known to spend a lot of money .
people were interested in seeing him , but it was recognized that the route was through so ##the ##by ' s and particularly george wa ##cht ##er . ' '
mr . paul thus developed a close , sy ##mb ##iot ##ic relationship with so ##the ##by ' s .
mr . paul was eager to assemble a collection for the headquarters cent ##rus ##t has been moving into for the greater part of a year .
european dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters , which so ##the ##by ' s north america had lately been to ##uting in this country .
for several months , there was optimism all around .
the painting , attributed to flemish artist peter paul ruben ##s , was purchased privately through so ##the ##by ' s , not at auction .
- l ##rb - mr . paul says it was n ' t that high . - rr ##b -
the state gave cent ##rus ##t 30 days to sell the ruben ##s .
in other words : get rid of all the pictures .
it came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that mr . paul has benefited handsome ##ly from his association with cent ##rus ##t .
for instance , he got a $ 3 million loan from the s & l , negotiated at a below - market rate .
he owns 43 % of cent ##rus ##t ' s shares .
david tunic ##k , the president of david tunic ##k inc . , a new york gallery , says scholars question the authenticity of the ruben ##s .
it may have been painted instead by a ruben ##s associate .
` ` it sounds like with the ruben ##s he got absolutely taken to the cleaner ##s . ' '
` ` i ' m forever dumb ##founded by what i see making these high prices . ' '
dealers contempt ##uous of the purchase price , he says , were themselves interested in buying the ruben ##s but lost out .
mr . paul , for his part , defend ##s the ruben ##s price , saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself .
` ` most of them were n ' t even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly , ' ' he says .
art prices are sky ##rock ##eti ##ng , but a good deal of leger ##de ##main is involved in compiling statistics on sales .
the percentage ##s om ##it from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction .
but art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale .
- l ##rb - the painting is 10 feet wide , seven feet high . - rr ##b -
rather , ` ` it just shows things have changed . ' '
mr . paul boasts that he spotted bargain ##s in old masters just before they took an upward turn .
` ` they went up 51 % last year , and they ' ll do it again this year , ' ' he declares .
so ##the ##by ' s vice president diana levi ##tt says the auction house has been ` ` assisting ' ' mr . paul in selling the paintings .
mr . paul claims to have sold three paintings , at more than a 10 % profit .
that is n ' t 51 % , and the claim is n ' t documented .
he furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on so ##the ##by ' s or mr . wa ##cht ##er .
mr . paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid imp ##ulsive ##ly .
after all , he had the counsel of ` ` curator ##s from the most rep ##utable museums in the world . ' '
but in art - world par ##lance , mr . paul ' s holdings are ` ` burnt . ' '
but quick turnover in artwork is ` ` like pawn ##ing your jewelry - - you end up with 50 % .
people hold out and try to get a bargain . ' '
so ##the ##by ' s defend ##s itself and mr . paul in the matter .
mr . wa ##cht ##er says mr . paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment .
so ##the ##by ' s , she says , is ` ` wearing both hats . ' '
` ` i ca n ' t see why there would be a conflict of interest , ' ' says so ##the ##by ' s ms . levi ##tt .
because of the pressure on cent ##rus ##t to sell , dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at bargain - basement prices .
but so far , mr . paul and his advisers are holding fast .
meanwhile , mr . paul and cent ##rus ##t executives are getting sq ##ue ##ami ##sh about op ##ule ##nce .
the media , she says , have distorted his personal life .
` ` i do n ' t think i have a life style that is , frankly , so fl ##am ##boy ##ant , ' ' he says .
mr . paul says , yes , the ceiling in his executive suite is gold - leaf in ##lay .
the offices are done in hardwood and oriental rug ##s , leather ##bound books and , of course , a $ 12 million ruben ##s .
but he imp ##lore ##s that the sp ##len ##dor be played down .
` ` do n ' t say it ' s a gold ceiling .
just say the offices are taste ##fully appointed , ' ' he says .
` ` otherwise , the regulators will take it for decade ##nce , and nowadays everything ' s got to be pristine . ' '
figures do n ' t include taxes or transaction costs .

korean car exports have slid about 40 % so far this year , but auto makers here are n ' t panic ##king .
they are enjoying domestic sales that are more than making up for lost overseas sales .
south korean consumers are expected to buy almost 500 , 000 passenger cars this year , up 60 % from 1988 .
as it is , waiting lists of a month are n ' t unusual for popular models .
industry analysts predict that by 1995 , south korea will be building three million cars a year - - about half of that for export .
it ' s an optimistic move in a industry already facing world - wide over ##cap ##ac ##ity .
but south korean auto makers are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in korea will stay strong .
currently only one in 38 south koreans owns a car , up from one in 200 a decade ago .
` ` in the year 2000 it will be one car per family .
at that point domestic sales will slow down , ' ' says kim yoon kw ##on , director of marketing for da ##ew ##oo motor .
the reason for the tremendous demand is simple : south koreans suddenly have a lot more money .
she and her husband started a small printing business and need the car for work as well as for weekend ja ##unt ##s .
pay raises of 60 % over the past three years have given many south koreans the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world .
the success of newcomer ss ##ang ##yon ##g motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity .
a part of the construction - oriented conglomerate ss ##ang ##yon ##g group , it took over the dying dong - a motor co . in 1986 .
ss ##ang ##yon ##g began making variations of the jeep - like ` ` ko ##rand ##o ' ' vehicle .
the most popular style is the stretched ` ` family , ' ' which resembles a ford bro ##nco or chevy blaze ##r .
the four - wheel - drive vehicles start at $ 15 , 000 ; a family can cost over $ 25 , 000 .
it sees sales rising 45 % to 26 , 000 units next year .
the company plans to expand plant capacity 50 % by 1991 .
by then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the volvo 240 and selling for about $ 20 , 000 .
it plans to sell 1 , 700 units in 1989 .
kia , the only korean car maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in 1989 , aims at korea ' s common man .
its advantage has been the pep ##py little pride , sold as the ford fest ##iva in the u . s . .
at 3 . 8 million won , or $ 5 , 700 , the eco ##nob ##ox is the lowest - priced car in south korea .
along with two larger models , the company claims 18 % of the domestic market .
ford motor co . and japan ' s mazda motor corp . have equity interests in kia .
kia is the most aggressive of the korean big three in offering financing .
loans for as long as five years make the cars very accessible , with monthly payments as low as 80 , 000 won , or $ 120 .
moreover , da ##ew ##oo ' s domestic sales have grown half as fast as sales of its rivals .
the big problem for da ##ew ##oo , which holds about 21 % of the market , is the long series of labor disruption ##s it suffered this year .
in fact , a sister company , da ##ew ##oo shipbuilding and heavy machinery , plans to build 240 , 000 mini ##cars by the mid - 1990s .
hyundai , the korean market leader with a 58 % share , also plans to jump into mini ##cars at the same time .
it has a similar project for 200 , 000 cars a year .
even giant samsung group is rumored in the korean press to be considering getting into the auto - making business ; a company spokesman had no comment .

many ski ##tti ##sh mutual fund investors picked up the phone yesterday , but decided not to cash in their chips after all .
much of the money was switched into the firm ' s money market funds .
out ##flow ##s since the close of trading friday remain below one - third their level of two years ago , fidelity said .
other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests .
and some investors at fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day .
this time , ` ` we do n ' t have that at all . ' '
of course , the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunge ##s again .
and any strong surge in redemption ##s could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash , as some did during black monday .
but funds generally are better prepared this time around .
many fund managers have boosted their cash levels in recent weeks .
the biggest flu ##rry of investor activity came early in the day .
vanguard group inc . saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at 8 : 30 a . m .
` ` in the first hour , the real nervous folks came along , ' ' a spokesman said .
` ` but the ho ##rre ##ndo ##us pace of call volume in the first half - hour slowed considerably . ' '
at sc ##ud ##der , stevens & clark inc . , phone calls came in at 40 % more than the normal pace through early afternoon .
most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at 8 a . m .
as stocks rose , in fact , some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders .
many funds allow investors to void orders before the close of trading .
but by 3 : 15 p . m . , with the market comfortably ahead for the day , mr . sherman was preparing to undo his switch .
much of the money has been switched into money market funds , fund executives say .
instead of selling bonds to meet redemption ##s , however , some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests .
that way , mr . collins says , ` ` we did n ' t have to sell securities in a sloppy market . ' '
when the market stabilized , he added , the firm sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back .
amc ##ore financial inc . said it agreed to acquire central of illinois inc . in a stock swap .
for the first nine months of 1989 , central earned $ 2 million .
amc ##ore , also a bank holding company , has assets of $ 1 . 06 billion .
soft contact lenses won federal blessing on march 18 , 1971 , and quickly became eye opener ##s for their makers .
the food and drug administration that day said ba ##us ##ch & lo ##mb could start selling them in the u . s . .
the corn ##fl ##ake - size product was more comfortable and less prone to falling out than hard contact lenses , which had been around since 1939 .
otto wi ##cht ##er ##le , a czech , invented them in 1962 .
the plastic lens wraps itself over the corn ##ea , absorbing eye moisture while permitting oxygen to pass through .
but the new lens became the eye of a storm .
in october doctors were debating the product ' s safety , some claiming it caused infections .
and there were senate hearings on the questions in july 1972 .
the product overcame the bad publicity and kept evolving .
the early soft lenses , which cost $ 300 a set , were expected to last for a year .
in 1983 ` ` extended wear ' ' versions , designed to be worn for 30 days at a time , wr ##ee offered .
eighteen months ago a ` ` di ##sp ##osa ##ble ' ' seven - day model bowed ; a year ' s supply costs about $ 500 .
last month the fda and contact lens institute caution ##ed users that serious eye infections could result from wearing lenses more than seven days at a stretch .
today 20 million of the 25 million americans using contact lenses are using the soft type .
including the acc ##es ##ory eye care products , contacts account for $ 2 billion in annual retail sales .
although ba ##us ##ch remains the leader among the six majors , johnson & johnson , with its new di ##sp ##osa ##bles , is coming on fast .
the roller - coaster stock market is making life tough ##er for small companies trying to raise money .
in the wake of friday ' s plunge and yesterday ' s rebound , some companies are already post ##pon ##ing deals , and others wish they could .
even if stock prices fully recover from friday ' s sharp decline , the un ##sett ##led conditions will fright ##en many investors .
` ` the more variables that indicate risk , the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain . ' '
at the time , its shares were selling above their initial offering price of $ 19 , and bankers believed staples would sell new stock without a hitch .
but with the company ' s shares standing at $ 15 yesterday , a new offering seems unlikely , company officials say .
other companies figure they ca n ' t avoid the market .
and the columbia , md . , company may have to settle for a lower price , he adds .
life is particularly nerve - rack ##ing for companies that had planned to go public this week .
hand - holding is becoming an investment - banking job requirement .
robertson , stephens & co . , a san francisco investment banking concern , has a client that looked forward to making its initial public offering yesterday .
as the market dropped friday , robertson stephens slashed the value of the offering by 7 % .
yesterday , when similar securities rebound ##ed , it bumped the valuation up again .
as of late yesterday , the ip ##o was still on .
for many , the situation is especially disco ##ura ##ging because the market for ip ##os was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness .
` ` but the tunnel ' s just gotten longer . ' '
he calculate ##s that the recent market slide translated into a 5 % to 7 % reduction in ip ##o proceeds to companies .
but now , peter be ##hre ##ndt , president , says , ` ` we ' re making decisions on a day - to - day basis . ' '
` ` it ' s a wait - and - see situation right now , ' ' says terry mc ##go ##wan , president .
delayed financing ##s also would affect the operations of many companies .
william o ' donnell , president , says he still thinks the ip ##o will succeed .
if it does n ' t , he says , the company would have to change its expansion timetable .
but the market turmoil could be partially beneficial for some small businesses .
for small companies , he says , interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges .
mr . za ##fr ##is thinks rates are heading down , helping small companies .
peter drake , biotechnology analyst for vector securities international , chicago , thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations .
partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high - technology concerns have made such alliances recently .
some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds .
instead , they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies , he says .
this will add to the appeal of small business , he says , where investors often have a degree of influence .
thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments .
according to its latest annual report , about a quarter of the company ' s holdings are in massachusetts , in the midst of a real - estate slump .

in his office overlooking the runway of shannon airport , mr . o ##vc ##har ##enko enthusiastically throws out what he calls ` ` just ideas ' ' :
ae ##r ri ##anta , the irish airport authority , could build a cargo terminal in the soviet union .
aero ##fl ##ot could lease some of its cargo planes to ae ##r ling ##us , through gp ##a , for a joint - venture cargo airline .
and then there is his notion of an irish - soviet charter airline to ferry armenians to los angeles via shannon .
have the freedoms of g ##las ##nos ##t gone to mr . o ##vc ##har ##enko ' s head ?
the irish - soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at shannon airport .
gp ##a is indeed talking about leasing western planes to aero ##fl ##ot and even about buying soviet - built tu ##pole ##v 204 ##s .
ae ##r ling ##us is in discussions with the soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities .
ae ##r ri ##anta already has so many ventures with aero ##fl ##ot that its chief executive is studying russian .
unlikely as it may seem , tiny , politically neutral ireland has penetrated the mighty soviet airline bureaucracy .
and as aero ##fl ##ot struggles to boost its service standards , upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities , the irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit .
` ` irish and soviet people are similar , ' ' says mr . o ##vc ##har ##enko .
moreover , he says , irish companies are small but spun ##ky .
` ` we have to study their experience very well , ' ' he says .
` ` we must find any way to get business . ' '
the two groups have been working together since the late 1970s , long before soviet joint ventures were the rage in the west .
an apartment complex down the road is the crew - rest and staging area for more than 130 aero ##fl ##ot pilots and flight attendants .
the airport ' s biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the soviet union .
tanker ##s from the latvian port of vents ##pi ##ls each year un ##load 25 million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport .
aero ##fl ##ot thus pays its landing fees , ground - handling and catering bills with fuel , preserving its hard currency .
ae ##r ri ##anta now manages duty - free sales on all aero ##fl ##ot international flights out of moscow .
aero ##fl ##ot ' s international fleet of 285 planes is being rep ##aint ##ed and refurbished at shannon airport .
the round - trip fare to havana is 410 irish punt ##s - l ##rb - $ 57 ##8 - rr ##b - .
when it opened in 1939 , shannon was the first landfall in europe for thirsty airplanes flying from north america .
today , ae ##r ri ##anta is making a heap of money from its soviet friendship .
and , with those contacts in place , it could be relatively simple to add ae ##r ling ##us and gp ##a to the team .
then , perhaps , mr . o ##vc ##har ##enko ' s ideas would n ' t sound like so much b ##lar ##ney .
the latest figures compare with july ' s 4 . 5 % month - to - month rise and 11 . 3 % year - to - year fall .
the new technology , which creates a very thin piece of steel , radically reduces the costs of making flat - rolled sheets .
` ` we ' ve had the russians and chinese , and people from india visiting us , ' ' mr . iv ##erson beams .
` ` everyone in the world is watching us very closely . ' '
especially his neighbors , the major u . s . steel ##makers .
already , us ##x corp . and arm ##co inc . are studying nu ##cor ' s technology to see if they can adopt it .
says the chief executive officer of a major midwest steel company : ` ` it ' s damn wo ##rri ##some . ' '
the once - st ##aid steel industry is about to be turned tops ##y - tu ##r ##vy by a 1990s technology revolution .
but such thin - slab technology is only the beginning .
those massive structures , while posing cost and environmental headache ##s , effectively locked out all but deep - pocket ##ed giants from steel ##making .
it is n ' t that major steel ##makers have b ##lit ##hel ##y ignored high technology .
moreover , their balance sheets are rich with diversity , their old plants shutter ##ed , and work forces lean .
but that wo n ' t su ##ffi ##ce .
` ` it ' s no longer enough to beat the guy down the street .
you have to beat everyone around the world , ' ' says mr . dennis .
he wants to see steel ##makers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence .
the problem : they ' re saddle ##d with huge plants that require costly maintenance .
` ` the technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers , ' ' says peter marcus , an analyst with pain ##ew ##eb ##ber inc .
` ` they ' ve got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n ' t get their workers to be flexible . ' '
moreover , the process is n ' t without its headache ##s .
because all operations are connected , one equipment failure forces a complete plant shut ##down .
on some days , the nu ##cor plant does n ' t produce anything .
indeed , with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity , steel ##makers will have to change the way they do business .
in the past , says arm ##co ' s chief economist john corey , steel ##makers made a product and set it out on the loading dock .
bat ##tell ##e ' s mr . mccall thinks steel ##makers should concentrate more on construction .
other steel ##makers en ##vision steel roofs covering suburb ##ia .
us ##x is funnel ##ing drilling pipe to steel - hungry soviet union .
this year , the nation ' s largest steel ##maker reactivated its overseas sales operation .
but unfortunately , that segment is much smaller than the bread - and - butter flat - rolled steel .
` ` after a while , someone has to go over the side . ' '
although he does n ' t expect any bankrupt ##cies , he does see more plants being sold or closed .
robert cr ##anda ##ll , with the brook ##ings institute , agrees .
not to mention the inc ##urs ##ion of imports .
japanese and european steel ##makers , which have led the recent technology developments , are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992 .
moreover , the u . s . can expect more competition from low - cost producing pacific rim and latin american countries .

after 78 days of mind - numb ##ing testimony in federal court in boston , the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys .
that may be the largest patent award ever , but it is well below the $ 12 billion polar ##oid seeks .
the two companies later agreed to settle for $ 95 million .
few analysts think it is worth their time to sl ##og through the polar ##oid trial testimony .
` ` it ' s like pan ##ning for gold outside of grand central station .
you might find something , but the chances are low , ' ' said michael el ##lman , an analyst at we ##rth ##eim sc ##hr ##oder & co .
the main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was ` ` will ##ful and deliberate . ' '
if so , the damages could be triple ##d .
it ' s difficult to be that consistently wrong . ' '
polar ##oid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by ko ##dak if ko ##dak had n ' t entered the market .
each side has called a harvard business school professor to testify on that issue .
ko ##dak hired robert buzz ##ell and polar ##oid brought in robert j . do ##lan .
` ` there ' s nothing that says that people at harvard business school have to agree with each other , ' ' said mr . buzz ##ell .
a decision is n ' t expected until some time next year .
in addition , ibm noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars .
revenue climbed 4 . 3 % to $ 14 . 31 billion from $ 13 . 71 billion .

the stock closed yesterday at $ 103 a share , up just $ 1 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange as the market surged .
analysts worry that the disk - drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter .
` ` and the input i ' ve had from customers is that it still could be a while . ' '
on leasing , bob dj ##ur ##d ##jevic at annex research said he thinks ibm has hurt itself un ##ne ##ces ##sari ##ly .
he said ibm has priced its leases aggressively , thinking that would help win business .
but he said ibm would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer .
he said ibm has not only hurt its short - term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases .
ibm is expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its main ##frame ##s .
ibm is gaining momentum in the personal - computer market , and is expected to introduce some impressive works ##tation ##s early next year .
the disk drives will doubt ##less sell well when they finally become available .
and expenses , up 7 . 9 % in the quarter , have stayed stubborn ##ly high .
revenue increased 6 . 5 % to $ 42 . 25 billion from $ 39 . 68 billion .
so far , analysts have said they are looking for $ 3 . 30 to $ 3 . 35 a share .
after today ' s announcement , that range could increase to $ 3 . 35 to $ 3 . 40 a share .
the official said he also would be comfortable with that new range .
in 1988 , the soft - drink giant earned $ 2 . 90 a share .

the company said third - quarter sales are expected to increase 25 % from $ 3 . 12 billion of last year ' s third quarter .
pepsi ##co said its soft - drink prices were about 2 % higher in the quarter .

the contract was to run from 1992 to 2020 .
hydro - quebec said maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract means central maine power has lost its place in line .
he said hydro - quebec already has some ` ` customers in mind ' ' for the power that was to be delivered to maine .
thus , options traders friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in new york .

de ##bor ##a foster takes off her necklace , settles herself on a padded chair and gently leans forward .
` ` it ' s like an oasis in this room , ' ' ms . foster pu ##rr ##s .
the room in question is the directors ' lounge of h . j . heinz co . , 60 floors above the bust ##le of pittsburgh .
there , amid oil paintings and marble tables , massage ##s are administered every wednesday .
in some companies middle managers sneak massage therapist ##s into the office , fearful that upper - level executives wo n ' t approve .
ms . foster ' s ind ##ul ##gence is nothing like the oil ##y , hour - long rub ##fest ##s enjoyed by spa visitors .
the massage ##s last 15 minutes and typically cost about $ 10 .
some companies , including heinz , even pay part of the fee .
ms . vi ##dun ##as has been seeing some 15 clients a visit since the program was started at heinz last year .
massage advocates say that kn ##ead ##ing the head , shoulders , neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale .
` ` when you leave the room after your massage , people say you look like you ' re glowing . ' '
not everyone , however , is at ease with office massage .
three years ago , the internal revenue service ' s office in san jose , cal ##if . , opened its doors to on - site massage .
and even though employees paid the bill , taxpayers grumbled .
` ` and you ca n ' t have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing ` o ##oh ##s ' and ` ah ##s . ' ' '
last month , the complaints intensified and the massage ##s ended .
` ` now we ' re looking for a room with thicker walls , ' ' ms . banks says .
massage also has an image problem to contend with .
but massage , no matter how cha ##ste , is still associated in many minds with seed ##y fronts for prostitution , and that makes some executives nervous .
phil harm ##s , a software engineer , was an eager customer .
` ` you build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day , ' ' he says .
but after about eight months , the vice president of the division , ed soul ##e , learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt .
given such attitudes , some corporate mass ##eurs prefer to go about their business quietly .
he visits the same department every two or three weeks .
his massage chair is kept in a closet , and a secretary escorts him past security .
managers , he contend ##s , ` ` are afraid how they ' re going to look in the eyes of their peers .
my vision is to change human consciousness towards touch .

` ` the culture is not ready to take off its clothes , lie down and be touched for an hour for $ 45 , ' ' he says .

customers lean forward , rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in pad ##ding on the back of the chair .
three minutes into the massage , the man curled up , began shaking and turned red .
a week later , the man told mr . mac ##inn ##is he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage .

but several weeks ago , in the wake of the beijing killings , the loan was canceled , according to bankers and executives close to the project .
asia development and sc ##hr ##oder ##s declined to comment on the move .
the decision to cancel the loan ex ##em ##pl ##ifies the tough attitude bankers have taken toward china since june 4 .
many bankers view property - sector loans as particularly risky .
the canceled shanghai loan leaves asia development , a small concern , saddle ##d with a half - completed 32 - story apartment building and heavy debts .
the project , known as lotus mansion , has been mir ##ed in controversy .
when the loan agreement was announced , it was hailed as one of the first western - style financing transactions ever used in china .
unlike most loans to china , there was no chinese gu ##aran ##tor .
the loan was to have mature ##d in just two to three years , as soon as construction was completed .
creditors involved in the project contend , however , that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations .
the bank syndicate is made up mostly of european banks , but it includes china ' s state - owned ci ##tic industrial bank .
the 11 banks in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn down .
warehouse clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products , which they sell for close to wholesale prices in no - fr ##ill ##s stores .
shop ##pers , many of whom operate small businesses , pay annual membership fees , which provide an income base for the stores .
k mart tested the warehouse - club sector last year with its acquisition of a 51 % interest in ma ##kr ##o inc .
six - year - old pace , based in aurora , col ##o . , operates 41 warehouse - club stores .
the company had losses for several years before turning profitable in fiscal 1988 .
` ` warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off . ' '
but some analysts contend k mart has agreed to pay too much for pace .
` ` in my opinion , you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry . ' '
ms . mc ##gl ##ade of pain ##ew ##eb ##ber raised a more fundamental question about the deal .
` ` if k mart ca n ' t get its act together in discount ##ing , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets ? ' '
at that point , perhaps divers ##ification would be appropriate . ' '
but k mart ' s mr . anton ##ini is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses .
it also operates walden ##books , pay less drug stores and builders square home improvement stores .
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , k mart closed yesterday at $ 36 a share , up 12 . 5 cents .
pace rose $ 2 . 625 to close at $ 22 . 125 a share in national over - the - counter trading .
a k mart spokesman said the acquisition would be financed with short - term borrowing ##s .
under terms of the agreement , a k mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for pace shares .
among the conditions of the offer is that pace shareholders tender a majority of the company ' s shares outstanding .
the companies said pace would ill continue to operate under its present management .

traders nervously watching their quo ##tron electronic - data machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the dow jones industrial average plum ##met 99 points in seconds .
a minute later it soared 128 points , then zoom ##ed back down 113 points , 69 below friday ' s close .
` ` it was crazy , ' ' said neil wei ##sman , general partner of chi ##lma ##rk capital corp .
` ` it was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane . ' '
but those who said ` ` this ca n ' t be happening ' ' were right .
the prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct , quo ##tron said , but the average was wrong .
meanwhile , there was an awful lot of confusion .
at the time , quo ##tron was reporting that the industrial average was down 70 points .
` ` it ' s been kind of annoying , to say the least , ' ' she said .
that was the new york stock exchange ' s b ##lo ##oper .
a spokesman cited a ` ` technical error ' ' and declined to elaborate .
` ` it was a case of human error , which we found almost immediately and corrected , ' ' a spokesman for re ##uter in new york said .
meanwhile , some currency traders at west german banks in frankfurt said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices .
but it was the quo ##tron problems that had lingering effects .
it was the second time in less than a week that quo ##tron has had problems calculating the industrial average .
at the start of trading last wednesday , the average appeared to plunge more than 200 points .
actually , it was down only a few points at the time .
a quo ##tron spoke ##sw ##oman said recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday ' s problems .
she said quo ##tron switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected .
` ` today of all days , ' ' she lame ##nted .

mr . alexander says he regards the agreement , which has n ' t been submitted to a judge , as something of a joke .

after two years of drought , it rained money in the stock - index futures markets yesterday .
the sudden influx of liquid ##ity enabled several traders to re ##ap six - figure wind ##falls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said .
` ` guys were mint ##ing money in there today , ' ' said john leg ##itt ##ino , a futures broker for elders futures inc . in chicago .
each index point represents a $ 500 profit for each s & p 500 contract held .
many institutions and individual investors have shi ##ed away from stock - index futures , blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on black monday two years ago .
more than 400 traders jammed the s & p 500 futures pit to await the opening bell .
traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8 : 30 am
but several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts , driving prices sharply higher .
the s & p 500 contract that ex ##pire ##s in december closed up a record 15 . 65 points on volume of nearly 80 , 000 contracts .
` ` traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart , ' ' said one s & p 500 broker .
` ` you could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune , ' ' he marvel ##ed .
sal ##omo ##n brothers was among the largest sellers of stock - index futures last week , traders said .

but the junk recovery , led by the bell ##we ##ther r ##j ##r holdings bonds , was pre ##car ##ious .
no trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds , securities industry officials said .
` ` but we had a fairly active day yesterday . ' '
` ` now , i feel maybe there ' s a little bit of eu ##ph ##oria . ' '
` ` liquid ##ity has n ' t returned to the vast middle ground of the market , ' ' said mr . mine ##lla of merrill .
` ` the dead ##beat ##s are still dead ##beat ##s , ' ' said mr . fein ##man of dr ##ex ##el .
analysts are concerned that much of the high - yield market will remain treacherous for investors .
` ` there ' s a whole bunch of stuff that ' s money good and a whole bunch of stuff that ' s not so good . ' '
analysts at standard & poor ' s say junk bond offerings by ` ` tightly stretched ' ' issue ##rs seem to be growing .
` ` you could still have some very bad times ahead , ' ' said mr . bach ##mann .
i ' m certainly not comfortable saying we ' ve seen the bottom . ' '
but yesterday ' s rally among ` ` good ' ' junk was a badly needed tonic for the market .
traders said yesterday ' s rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargain ##s after a drastic slide in prices the past month .
in addition , mutual funds did n ' t appear to be major sellers of high - yield securities as was expected .
` ` sometimes a shake ##out is healthy , ' ' said dr ##ex ##el ' s mr . fein ##man .
` ` people will learn to be more ci ##rc ##ums ##pe ##ct .
if they do good credit analysis , they will avoid the hand grenades .
that ' s a question a lot of people are asking , following the stock market ' s stunning display of vol ##ati ##lity .
the answer , say academic researchers , money managers and investment specialists , is yes - - as long as you approach the stock market as an investor .
the case for owning stocks over the long - term is compelling .
the longer the time period , the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market .
over time , the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio .
stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he says .
he says individuals should consider not just stocks , but other long - term investments , such as high - quality bonds .
despite the strong case for stocks , however , most pro ##s warn that individuals should n ' t try to profit from short - term developments .
` ` our markets move so fast and they are so volatile , there ' s no way the average investor can compete with the pro ##s . ' '
individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market .
and assuming their first investment is successful , investors will have to pay taxes on their gains .
that can reduce returns by a third or more , once local taxes are included , mr . lip ##per says .
` ` it ' s very tough for most individuals to out - trade the mutual funds or the market , ' ' says mr . lip ##per .
` ` you should really think twice if you think you can out - smart the system . ' '
then , too , many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market .
so what ' s the best way to buy stocks ?
` ` it ' s now selling at a multiple about even with the market , ' ' says mr . douglas .
moreover , mr . douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term .
` ` we ' re seeing a real turn ##around in interest in small growth stocks , ' ' he says .
the pro ##s st ##ren ##uously advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fa ##d .
` ` buy stocks on weakness for their long - term fundamental ##s , ' ' he says .
in the long run , investment advisers say , most investors will be better off using the dollar - cost averaging method of buying stocks .
in this method , a person invest ##s a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down .
that cuts the risk , mr . gregory , the san francisco money manager , points out .
a disciplined program will work the best , mr . bo ##ese ##l says .
` ` one of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down , ' ' he says .
` ` but that ' s just the time when you should be buying them . ' '

in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt - market fund inc . , initial offering of five million common shares , via smith barney , harris up ##ham & co .
but a lower bid could face rejection by the ua ##l board .
he said he might now sell his am ##r stake , buy more shares , or make another offer at a lower price .
` ` he ' s done this thing where he ' ll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it .
he ' s written this book , ` the art of the deal . '
why does n ' t he just follow through on one of these things ? ' '
mr . trump withdrew his bid before the am ##r board , which is due to meet tomorrow , ever formally considered it .
am ##r declined to comment , and mr . trump did n ' t respond to requests for interviews .
mr . trump never said how much am ##r stock he had bought , only that his holdings were ` ` substantial . ' '
between then and his bid on oct . 5 , the price flu ##ctuated between $ 75 . 625 and $ 87 . 375 .
am ##r was trading at around $ 84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement , then immediately fell to about $ 76 .
ray ne ##id ##l of dillon read & co . said mr . trump ` ` is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle .
i ' m sure he still wants am ##r . ' '
` ` what happened with united was a gr ##acious way for him to bow out . ' '
mr . trump never obtained financing for his bid .
at $ 250 a share , the group would have to borrow about $ 6 . 1 billion from banks .
the first ua ##l deal un ##rave ##led after ci ##ti ##bank and chase could n ' t raise $ 7 . 2 billion .
together , ci ##tic ##or ##p and chase received $ 8 million in fees to raise the rest of the financing .
but other banks bal ##ked at the low interest rate and banking fees the ua ##l group was willing to pay them .
nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders .
the group ' s advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around .
even if the buy - out group is able to obtain financing , the transaction still faces obstacles .
ua ##l ' s board could reject the new price as too low , especially since there are n ' t any competing bids .
the group ' s res ##ili ##ence gets its first test today when 30 top pilot union leaders con ##ven ##e outside chicago in a previously scheduled meeting .
the pilot union is vow ##ing to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides .
the pilots could play hard ##ball by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes .
that could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bid ##der .
