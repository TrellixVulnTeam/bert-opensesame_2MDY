mr . vin ##ken is chairman of else ##vier n . v . , the dutch publishing group .
a lori ##llar ##d spoke ##woman said , ` ` this is an old story .
we ' re talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
there is no asbestos in our products now . ' '
neither lori ##llar ##d nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smoke ##rs of the kent cigarettes .
dr . tal ##cott led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university .
from 1953 to 1955 , 9 . 8 billion kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said .
among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died - - more than three times the expected number .
four of the five surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
the total of 18 deaths from mali ##gnant me ##so ##the ##lio ##ma , lung cancer and asbestos ##is was far higher than expected , the researchers said .
` ` the mor ##bid ##ity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases , ' ' said dr . tal ##cott .
the plant , which is owned by ho ##lling ##sworth & vo ##se co . , was under contract with lori ##llar ##d to make the cigarette filters .
more common ch ##rys ##ot ##ile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , dr . moss ##man explained .
in july , the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .
by 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing asbestos will be outlawed .
about 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s .
areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the cr ##oc ##ido ##lite was used .
workers described ` ` clouds of blue dust ' ' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans vent ##ila ##ted the area .
` ` but you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago .
it has no bearing on our work force today .
yields on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates .
compound yields assume rein ##ves ##tment of divide ##nds and that the current yield continues for a year .
average maturity of the funds ' investments length ##ened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early august , according to don ##og ##hue ' s .
longer mat ##urities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
shorter mat ##urities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
the yield on six - month treasury bills sold at monday ' s auction , for example , rose to 8 . 04 % from 7 . 90 % .
despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .
assets of the 400 taxa ##ble funds grew by $ 1 . 5 billion during the latest week , to $ 352 . 7 billion .
typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary mat ##urities and go after the highest rates .
the top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .
it invest ##s heavily in dollar - den ##omi ##nated securities overseas and is currently wai ##ving management fees , which boost ##s its yield .
the average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8 . 12 % , down from 8 . 14 % .

the federal government suspended sales of u . s . savings bonds because congress has n ' t lifted the ceiling on government debt .
until congress acts , the government has n ' t any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the treasury said .
the government ' s borrowing authority dropped at midnight tuesday to $ 2 . 80 trillion from $ 2 . 87 trillion .
legislation to lift the debt ceiling is en ##s ##nar ##led in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes .

south korea ' s economic boom , which began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and slug ##gis ##h exports .
government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion .

mr . rowe also noted that political concerns also worried new england electric .
no matter who owns ps of new hampshire , after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation , he said .
it was just another one of the risk factors ' ' that led to the company ' s decision to withdraw from the bidding , he added .
` ` now the field is less cl ##uttered , ' ' he added .
separately , the federal energy regulatory commission turned down for now a request by northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of ps of new hampshire .

` ` the ref ##und pool . . . may not be held hostage through another round of appeals , ' ' judge curry said .
commonwealth edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing judge curry ' s order .
the exact amount of the ref ##und will be determined next year based on actual collections made until dec . 31 of this year .
commonwealth edison said the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $ 1 . 55 a share .
for 1988 , commonwealth edison reported earnings of $ 737 . 5 million , or $ 3 . 01 a share .
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , commonwealth edison closed at $ 38 . 375 , down 12 . 5 cents .
the $ 2 . 5 billion byron 1 plant near rock ##ford , ill . , was completed in 1985 .
in a disputed 1985 ruling , the commerce commission said commonwealth edison could raise its electricity rates by $ 49 million to pay for the plant .
but state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission ' s rate increase and found the rates illegal .
the illinois supreme court ordered the commission to audit commonwealth edison ' s construction expenses and ref ##und any unreasonable expenses .
the utility has been collecting for the plant ' s construction cost from its 3 . 1 million customers subject to a ref ##und since 1986 .
in his ruling , judge curry added an additional $ 55 million to the commission ' s calculations .
last month , judge curry set the interest rate on the ref ##und at 9 % .
commonwealth edison is seeking about $ 245 million in rate increases to pay for braid ##wood 2 .
the commission is expected to rule on the braid ##wood 2 case by year end .
last year commonwealth edison had to ref ##und $ 72 . 7 million for poor performance of its las ##alle i nuclear plant .

not only is development of the new company ' s initial machine tied directly to mr . cr ##ay , so is its balance sheet .
moreover , there have been no orders for the cr ##ay - 3 so far , though the company says it is talking with several prospects .
` ` the theory is that seymour is the chief designer of the cr ##ay - 3 , and without him it could not be completed .
cr ##ay research did not want to fund a project that did not include seymour . ' '
the documents also said that cr ##ay computer anti ##ci ##pate ##s needing perhaps another $ 120 million in financing beginning next september .
but mr . barn ##um called that ` ` a worst - case ' ' scenario .
` ` cr ##ay computer will be a concept stock , ' ' he said .
` ` you either believe seymour can do it again or you do n ' t . ' '
in addition , the cr ##ay - 3 will contain 16 processors - - twice as many as the largest current super ##com ##put ##er .
no price for the new shares has been set .
instead , the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide .
cr ##ay computer has applied to trade on nas ##da ##q .
analysts calculate cr ##ay computer ' s initial book value at about $ 4 . 75 a share .
pro - form ##a balance sheets clearly show why cr ##ay research favored the spin ##off .
on the other hand , had it existed then , cr ##ay computer would have incurred a $ 20 . 5 million loss .
regarded as the father of the super ##com ##put ##er , mr . cr ##ay was paid $ 600 , 000 at cr ##ay research last year .
at cr ##ay computer , he will be paid $ 240 , 000 .
cr ##ay computer , which currently employs 241 people , said it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990 .

three computers that changed the face of personal computing were launched in 1977 .
that year the apple ii , commodore pet and tan ##dy tr ##s - 80 came to market .
the computers were crude by today ' s standards .
apple ii owners , for example , had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audio ##cas ##sett ##es .
in addition , the apple ii was an affordable $ 1 , 298 .
crude as they were , these early pcs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office .
big main ##frame computers for business had been around for years .
current pcs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts .
alan f . shu ##gart , currently chairman of sea ##gate technology , led the team that developed the disk drives for pcs .
dennis hayes and dale heather ##ington , two atlanta engineers , were co - developers of the internal mode ##ms that allow pcs to share data via the telephone .
ibm , the world leader in computers , did n ' t offer its first pc until august 1981 as many other companies entered the market .

the company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years , despite steady sales growth .
on the toronto stock exchange yesterday , magna shares closed up 37 . 5 canadian cents to c $ 9 . 625 .
analysts said mr . st ##rona ##ch wants to resume a more influential role in running the company .

he said more than 90 % of the funds were placed with japanese institutional investors .
the rest went to investors from france and hong kong .
earlier this year , japanese investors snapped up a similar , $ 570 million mortgage - backed securities mutual fund .
that fund was put together by blacks ##tone group , a new york investment bank .
the latest two funds were assembled jointly by goldman , sachs & co . of the u . s . and japan ' s dai ##wa securities co .
second , they channel monthly mortgage payments into semi ##ann ##ual payments , reducing the administrative burden on investors .
the offer , advertised in today ' s editions of the wall street journal , is scheduled to ex ##pire at the end of november .
monte ##dis ##on currently owns about 72 % of er ##ba ##mont ' s common shares outstanding .
the offer is being launched pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies .
the announcement follows a sharpe ##r $ 2 . 2 billion decline in the country ' s foreign reserves in september to $ 86 . 12 billion .
the turf recently has ranged from chile to austria to portugal .
the surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in new york or london .
these funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets .
behind all the hoop ##la is some heavy - duty competition .
as individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years , securities firms have scrambled to find new products that broker ##s find easy to sell .
and the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it .
financial planners often urge investors to divers ##ify and to hold a sm ##atter ##ing of international securities .
and many emerging markets have out ##pace ##d more mature markets , such as the u . s . and japan .
country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies .
but it does n ' t take much to get burned .
political and currency g ##yra ##tions can whip ##sa ##w the funds .
another concern : the funds ' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market .
when the stock market dropped nearly 7 % oct . 13 , for instance , the mexico fund plunged about 18 % and the spain fund fell 16 % .
and most country funds were cl ##ob ##bered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash .
the reason : share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold .
but some european funds recently have sky ##rock ##ete ##d ; spain fund has surged to a startling 120 % premium .
it has been targeted by japanese investors as a good long - term play tied to 1992 ' s european economic integration .
and several new funds that are n ' t even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premium ##s .
` ` i ' m very alarmed to see these rich valuation ##s , ' ' says smith barney ' s mr . porter .
the newly fat ##ten ##ed premium ##s reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds , mr . porter suggests .
unlike many u . s . investors , those in asia or europe seeking foreign - stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds .
` ` there may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here , ' ' mr . porter says .
nonetheless , plenty of u . s . analysts and money managers are ag ##has ##t at the loft ##y trading levels of some country funds .
that way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium .
if the debts are rep ##aid , it could clear the way for soviet bonds to be sold in the u . s . .
coincide ##nt with the talks , the state department said it has permitted a soviet bank to open a new york branch .

the u . s . s . r . belongs to neither organization .
moscow has settled pre - 1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value .

meanwhile , the national association of purchasing management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in october for the sixth consecutive month .
its index inched up to 47 . 6 % in october from 46 % in september .
any reading below 50 % suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining .
the purchasing managers , however , also said that orders turned up in october after four months of decline .
factories booked $ 236 . 74 billion in orders in september , nearly the same as the $ 236 . 79 billion in august , the commerce department said .
if not for a 59 . 6 % surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors , factory orders would have fallen 2 . 1 % .
private construction spending was down , but government building activity was up .
the figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns , but were n ' t adjusted for inflation .
kenneth may ##land , economist for society corp . , a cleveland bank , said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to tape ##r off .
at the same time , the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry .
` ` what sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack ? ' ' he asked .
by most measures , the nation ' s industrial sector is now growing very slowly - - if at all .
so did the federal reserve board ' s industrial - production index .
yet many economists are n ' t predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession .
they cite a lack of ` ` im ##balance ##s ' ' that provide early warning signals of a down ##turn .
inventor ##ies are closely watched for such clues , for instance .
economists say a build ##up in inventor ##ies can provoke cut ##backs in production that can lead to a recession .
` ` i do n ' t see any signs that inventor ##ies are excessive . ' '
a soft landing is an economic slow ##down that ease ##s inflation without leading to a recession .
orders for durable goods were up 0 . 2 % to $ 127 . 03 billion after rising 3 . 9 % the month before .
the department previously estimated that durable - goods orders fell 0 . 1 % in september .
factory shipments fell 1 . 6 % to $ 234 . 4 billion after rising 5 . 4 % in august .
shipments have been relatively level since january , the commerce department noted .
excluding these orders , back ##log ##s declined 0 . 3 % .
government construction spending rose 4 . 3 % to $ 88 billion .
after adjusting for inflation , the commerce department said construction spending did n ' t change in september .
for the first nine months of the year , total construction spending ran about 2 % above last year ' s level .
dodge reported an 8 % increase in construction contracts awarded in september .
the gov ##er ##ment counts money as it is spent ; dodge counts contracts when they are awarded .
the government includes money spent on residential renovation ; dodge does n ' t .
he said the index would have to be in the low 40 % range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession .
the report offered new evidence that the nation ' s export growth , though still continuing , may be slowing .
only 19 % of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in october , down from 27 % in september .
and 8 % said export orders were down last month , compared with 6 % the month before .
the pu ##rh ##asi ##ng managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control .
for the fifth consecutive month , purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell .
the decline was even steep ##er than in september .
they also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in october than they had for each of the five previous months .
economists consider that a sign that inflation ##ary pressures are aba ##ting .
when demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times length ##en , prices tend to rise .
the purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives .
for the first time , the october survey polled members on imports .
it found that of the 73 % who import , 10 % said they imported more in october and 12 % said they imported less than the previous month .
items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen , but they included one newcomer : milk and milk powder .
` ` it ' s an odd thing to put on the list , ' ' mr . bret ##z noted .
he said that for the second month in a row , food processors reported a shortage of non ##fat dry milk .
they blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high u . s . exports of dry milk , coupled with very low import quota ##s .

the three japanese companies build the body sections of the 76 ##7 , accounting for a combined 15 % of the aircraft .
japanese press reports have speculated that the japanese contribution could rise to between 20 % and 25 % under the new program .
if boeing goes ahead with the larger 76 ##7 , the plane could hit the market in the mid - 1990s .
this is the year the negative ad , for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns , became the main event .
and , unlike a few years ago , you do n ' t even have to worry whether the ad is truth ##ful . ' '
in 1989 , as often as not , the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves .
take a look , then , at the main attack commercials that set the tone for tuesday ' s elections in new york city , new jersey and virginia :
the screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of david din ##kins , democratic candidate for mayor of new york city .
` ` david din ##kins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years , ' ' says a di ##se ##mbo ##die ##d male voice .
` ` david din ##kins , ' ' says the kicker , ` ` why does he always wait until he ' s caught ? ' '
the screen shows two distorted , un ##re ##co ##gni ##za ##ble photos , presumably of two politicians .
` ` compare two candidates for mayor , ' ' says the announcer .
` ` one says he ' s for banning cop - killer bullets .
the other has opposed a ban on cop - killer bullets .
the other has opposed a woman ' s right to choose . ' '
` ` funny thing , ' ' says the kicker , ` ` both these candidates are named rudolph gi ##ulia ##ni . ' '
it ' s a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate .
he was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he insists he made no secret of it .
the city ' s campaign finance board has refused to pay mr . din ##kins $ 95 , 142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete .
the campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors .
but , say mr . din ##kins ' s managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members .
mr . gi ##ulia ##ni ' s campaign chairman , peter powers , says the din ##kins ad is ` ` dec ##eptive . ' '
the other side , he argues , ` ` knows gi ##ulia ##ni has always been pro - choice , even though he has personal reservations .
they know he is generally opposed to cop - killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation . ' '
the coleman counterattack featured a close - up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
a voice says , ` ` c ' mon , now , do n ' t you have boyfriend ##s ? ' '
so the next time mr . wilder talks about the rights of women , ask him about this law he tried to pass . ' '
mr . coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours .
by tuesday night , television stations were carrying new ads featuring mr . coleman himself raising questions about mr . wilder ' s sensitivity to rape victims .
` ` remember pin ##oc ##chio ? ' ' says a female voice .
and then this commercial , produced by bob sq ##ui ##er , gets down to its own mean and dirty business .
and the nose on mr . court ##er ' s face grows .
in this one , the screen fills with photographs of both candidates .
` ` who ' s really lying ? ' ' asks a female voice .
mr . court ##er ' s long nose shrink ##s while mr . fl ##orio ' s grows .
barrels were dumped on the court ##er property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment .
but it ' s building on a long tradition .

the record price for a full membership on the exchange is $ 550 , 000 , set aug . 31 , 1987 .
japanese investment in southeast asia is prop ##elling the region toward economic integration .
but japan ' s power in the region also is spark ##ing fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions .
in the past five years , japanese companies have triple ##d their commitments in asia to $ 5 . 57 billion .
japan ' s commitment in southeast asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade .
asia ' s other cash - rich countries are following japan ' s lead and pumping capital into the region .
in taiwan and south korea , rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor - intensive production .
for recipient countries such as thailand and malaysia , the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth .
because of budget constraints in washington , the u . s . encourages japan to share economic burden ##s in the region .
japan ' s swelling investment in southeast asia is part of its economic evolution .
in the past decade , japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export .
in the 1990s , spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen , these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinational ##s with plants around the world .
to capture the investment , southeast asian nations will move to accommodate japanese business .
japanese money will help turn southeast asia into a more co ##hesive economic region .
but , analysts say , asian cooperation is n ' t likely to parallel the european common market approach .
in electronics , for example , a japanese company might make television picture tubes in japan , assemble the sets in malaysia and export them to indonesia .
countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties .
the baker proposal re ##asse ##rts washington ' s intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region .
` ` in asia , as in europe , a new order is taking shape , ' ' mr . baker said .
` ` the u . s . , with its regional friends , must play a crucial role in designing its architecture . ' '
but maintaining u . s . influence will be difficult in the face of japanese dominance in the region .
while u . s . officials voice optimism about japan ' s enlarged role in asia , they also convey an under ##tone of caution .
` ` if they approach it with a benevolent , alt ##ru ##istic attitude , there will be a net gain for everyone . ' '
many asian ##s regard a u . s . presence as a desirable counter ##weight to japanese influence .
` ` no one wants the u . s . to pick up its marble ##s and go home , ' ' mr . ho ##rma ##ts says .
for their part , taiwan and south korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the japanese jug ##ger ##naut .
cat ##hr ##yn rice could hardly believe her eyes .
while giving the comprehensive test of basic skills to ninth graders at greenville high school last march 16 , she spotted a student looking at cr ##ib sheets .
she had seen cheating before , but these notes were uncanny .
` ` a stock ##bro ##ker is an example of a profession in trade and finance . . . .
at the end of world war ii , germany surrendered before japan . . . .
the senate - house conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the house and senate in different forms . ' '
virtually word for word , the notes matched questions and answers on the social - studies section of the test the student was taking .
in fact , the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section .
the student surrendered the notes , but not without a protest .
` ` my teacher said it was ok for me to use the notes on the test , ' ' he said .
the teacher in question was nancy year ##gin - - considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school .
confronted , mrs . year ##gin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low - ability geography classes .
she had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead project ##or and under ##line the answers .
mrs . year ##gin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual south carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security .
in september , she pleaded guilty and paid a $ 500 fine .
she was an un ##sti ##nting teacher who won laurel ##s and inspired students , but she will probably never teach again .
the 1987 statute mrs . year ##gin violated was designed to enforce provisions of south carolina ' s school - improvement laws .
prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bo ##lster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state ' s 1984 education improvement act .
the bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student - test scores .
` ` so efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise . ' '
and most disturbing , it is educators , not students , who are blamed for much of the wrong ##do ##ing .
evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so .
california ' s education department suspects adult responsibility for eras ##ures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test .
after numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students , texas is rev ##ising its security practices .
and sales of test - coaching booklet ##s for classroom instruction are booming .
use of scoring high is widespread in south carolina and common in greenville county , mrs . year ##gin ' s school district .
experts say there is n ' t another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in south carolina .
critics say south carolina is paying a price by stress ##ing improved test scores so much .
friends of education rates south carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating .
partly because of worries about potential abuse , however , he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement - test preparation booklet ##s next spring .
south carolina ' s reforms were designed for schools like greenville high school .
but by the early 1980s , its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade .
` ` it was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class , ' ' says linda ward , the school ' s principal .
` ` crime was awful , test scores were low , and there was no enrollment in honors programs . ' '
mrs . ward took over in 1986 , becoming the school ' s seventh principal in 15 years .
prior to his term , a teacher bled to death in the halls , stabbed by a student .
one was statewide school reform , which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school better ##ment .
another was nancy year ##gin , who came to greenville in 1985 , full of the energy and ambitions that reformer ##s wanted to reward .
i even dream ##t about school and new things to do with my students . ' '
in 1986 - 87 and 1987 - 88 , she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law .
she says that because of mrs . year ##gin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher .
mary beth march ##and , a greenville 11th grade ##r , also says mrs . year ##gin inspired her to go into education .
` ` she taught us more in western civilization than i ' ve ever learned in other classes , ' ' says ke ##lli green , a greenville senior .
on weekends , she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes , even to polish the furniture in her classroom .
` ` she just never gave it up , ' ' says mary march ##and , mary beth ' s mother .
` ` you ' d see her correct ##ing homework in the stands at a football game . ' '
some fellow teachers , however , viewed mrs . year ##gin as cocky and too yielding to students .
mrs . ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grand ##stand ##er .
because of deteriorating hearing , she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer .
mrs . year ##gin ' s extra work was also helping her earn points in the state ' s incentive - bonus program .
but the most important source of points was student improvement on tests .
winning a bonus for a third year was n ' t that important to her , mrs . year ##gin insists .
but others at greenville high say she was eager to win - - if not for money , then for pride and recognition .
indeed , mrs . year ##gin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program .
when test booklet ##s were passed out 48 hours ahead of time , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students .
mrs . year ##gin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct .
` ` i was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation , ' ' she says .
` ` only five of the 40 questions were geography questions .
the rest were history , sociology , finance - - subjects they never had . ' '
mostly , she says , she wanted to prevent the damage to self - esteem that her low - ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test .
` ` these kids broke my heart , ' ' she says .
` ` a whole day goes by and no one even knows they ' re alive .
they desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them , who loved them .
the last thing they needed was another drag - down blow . ' '
school officials and prosecutors say mrs . year ##gin is lying .
mr . watson says mrs . year ##gin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair .
` ` do i have much sympathy for her ? ' ' mr . watson asks .
i believe you have to use the system to change it .
what she did was like taking the law into your own hands . ' '
mrs . ward says that when the cheating was discovered , she wanted to avoid the morale - damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring .
she says she offered mrs . year ##gin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate .
` ` she said something like ` you just want to make it easy for the school . '
i was dumb ##founded , ' ' mrs . ward recalls .
` ` it was like someone had turned a knife in me . ' '
the school - board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students , teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf .
supportive caller ##s dec ##ried unfair testing , not mrs . year ##gin , on a local radio talk show on which she appeared .
editorial ##s in the greenville newspaper allowed that mrs . year ##gin was wrong , but also said the case showed how testing was being over ##used .
the radio show ` ` enraged us , ' ' says mrs . ward .
and legal authorities crank ##ed up an investigation worthy of a murder case .
over 50 witnesses , mostly students , were interviewed .
at greenville high school , meanwhile , some students - - especially on the cheerleading squad - - were crushed .
` ` it ' s hard to explain to a 17 - year - old why someone they like had to go , ' ' says mrs . ward .
soon , t - shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school ' s familiar red - and - white g ##hs logo on the front .
on the back , the shirts read , ` ` we have all the answers . ' '
many colleagues are angry at mrs . year ##gin .
` ` she did a lot of harm , ' ' says cat ##hr ##yn rice , who had discovered the cr ##ib notes .
but several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores .
says gay ##le key , a mathematics teacher , ` ` the incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms .
there may be others doing what she did . ' '
mrs . ward , for one , was relieved .
since chalk first touched slate , school ##child ##ren have wanted to know : what ' s on the test ?
the mathematics section of the widely used california achievement test asks fifth graders : ` ` what is another name for the roman nu ##meral ix ? ' '
it also asks them to add two - seventh ##s and three - seventh ##s .
in many other instances , there is almost no difference between the real test and learning materials .
close parallels between tests and practice tests are common , some educators and researchers say .
test - preparation booklet ##s , software and works ##hee ##ts are a booming publishing sub ##ind ##ust ##ry .
but some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school - sponsored cheating .
he and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests , which is to gauge learning progress .
standardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade .
sales figures of the test - prep materials are n ' t known , but their reach into schools is significant .
in arizona , california , florida , louisiana , maryland , new jersey , south carolina and texas , educators say they are common classroom tools .
about 20 , 000 sets of learning materials teachers ' bind ##ers have also been sold in the past four years .
the materials in each set reach about 90 students .
scoring high and learning materials are the best - selling preparation tests .
he also asserted that exact questions were n ' t replicate ##d .
when referred to the questions that matched , he said it was coincide ##ntal .
but learning materials matched on 66 . 5 of 69 sub ##ski ##lls .
learning materials for the fifth - grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items .
when scoring high first came out in 1979 , it was a publication of random house .
but in 1988 , mcgraw - hill purchased the random house unit that publishes scoring high , which later became part of macmillan \ / mcgraw .
mess ##rs . browne ##ll and ke ##an say they are unaware of any efforts by mcgraw - hill to modify or disco ##nti ##nu ##e scoring high .

the department of health and human services plans to extend its mora ##torium on federal funding of research involving fetal - tissue transplant ##s .
james mason , assistant secretary for health , said the ban on federal funding of fetal - tissue transplant research ` ` should be continued indefinitely . ' '
the department placed a mora ##torium on the research , pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues .
several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal - tissue transplant ##s .
antonio novel ##lo , whom mr . bush nominated to serve as surgeon general , reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion .
dr . novel ##lo is deputy director of the national institute of child health and human development .
some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts .
but the administration ' s handling of the fetal - tissue transplant issue disturb ##s many scientists .
yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal - tissue transplant ##s .
but dr . gene ##l warns that dr . mason ' s ruling may discourage private funding .
despite the flap over transplant ##s , federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts .
the ni ##h currently spends about $ 8 million annually on fetal - tissue research out of a total research budget of $ 8 billion .

the internal revenue service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ 10 , 000 in cash .
the form asks for such details as the client ' s name , social security number , passport number and details about the services provided for the payment .
many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the irs in recent years , citing attorney - client privilege .
until last week , the irs rarely acted on the incomplete forms .
mr . son ##nett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n ' t have domestic bank accounts .
these individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers .
mr . son ##nett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n ' t want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers .
filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the irs off and spark action against the clients , he said .
the defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week , chaired by new york attorney gerald le ##fc ##our ##t , to deal with the matter .
the american bar association ' s house of delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the irs reporting requirement .
at that meeting , he said , the justice department assured him that enforcement procedures would n ' t be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice .
mr . ross said irs officials opposed the justice department ' s moderate stance on the matter .
in some cases , the irs asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985 .
individuals familiar with the justice department ' s policy said that justice officials had n ' t any knowledge of the irs ' s actions in the last week .
lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients , that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors .
prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business .
but they have obtained 83 ##00 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases .
some criminal lawyers speculated that the irs was sending the letters to test the issue .
in a number of recent cases , federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' assertion ##s that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential .
the war over federal judicial salaries takes a victim .
often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fan ##fare , but not federal judge raul a . ramirez in sacramento , cal ##if .
on tuesday , the judge called a news conference to say he was quit ##ting effective dec . 31 to join a san francisco law firm .
the reason : the refusal of congress to give federal judges a raise .
federal judges make $ 89 , 500 annually ; in february , congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50 % .
judge ramirez , 44 , said it is un ##just for judges to make what they do .
` ` judges are not getting what they deserve .
you look around at professional ball ##play ##ers or accountants . . . and nobody blink ##s an eye .
when you become a federal judge , all of a sudden you are relegated to a pal ##try sum . ' '
the judge declined to discuss his salary in detail , but said : ` ` i ' m going to be a high - priced lawyer . ' '
doo ##nes ##bury creator ' s union troubles are no laughing matter .
the dispute involves dark ##horse productions inc . , a tv production company in which mr . tr ##udeau is a co - owner .
the guild began a strike against the tv and movie industry in march 1988 .
in his lawsuit , mr . tr ##udeau says the strike illegally included dark ##horse , and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company .
a spokesman for the guild said the union ' s lawyers are reviewing the suit .
he said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against mr . tr ##udeau .
mr . sam ##nick said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next monday in new york .
in addition to the damages , the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punish ##ing or re ##tal ##iating against mr . tr ##udeau .
the rule also prohibits funding for activities that ` ` encourage , promote or advocate abortion . ' '

fuji ##tsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a u . s . penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years .
the company also disclosed that during that period it offered 10 , 000 yen , or about $ 70 , for another contract .
but fuji ##tsu , japan ' s no . 1 computer maker , is n ' t alone .
nec , one of its largest domestic competitors , said it bid one yen in two separate public auction ##s since 1987 .
in both cases , nec lost the contract to fuji ##tsu , which made the same bid and won a tie - breaking lottery .
all the contracts were for computer - system - design contracts and involved no hardware or software .
` ` these cases lead to the loss of the firms ' social and international credibility , ' ' a ministry statement said .
japan ' s fair trade commission has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible anti ##trust - law violations .
the bids , he added , were ` ` contrary to common sense . ' '
japanese companies have long had a reputation for sac ##ri ##fi ##cing short - term profits to make a sale that may have long - term benefits .
the fire is also fueled by growing international interest in japanese behavior .
so far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue .
the low - ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate .
foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in japan , in part because japanese companies unfair ##ly under ##cut them .
then wednesday , fuji ##tsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in naga ##no prefecture two weeks earlier .
the company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in hiroshima and naga ##no .
the municipalities said they have n ' t decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts .
fuji ##tsu and nec said they were still investigating , and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge .
mr . yamamoto insisted that headquarters had n ' t approved the bids , and that he did n ' t know about most of the cases until wednesday .
other major japanese computer companies contacted yesterday said they have never made such bids .

` ` in addition , recent industry forecast ##s for 1990 indicate a slow environment , at least until mid ##year . ' '
as a result , the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and ` ` make appropriate reductions ' ' in operating expenses .
the $ 35 . 7 million net loss equals 86 cents a share .
not counting the extraordinary charge , the company said it would have had a net loss of $ 3 . 1 million , or seven cents a share .
a year earlier , it had profit of $ 7 . 5 million , or 18 cents a share .
revenue rose 42 % to $ 133 . 7 million from $ 94 million .
the charge partly reflects a switch from older five - inch to more - efficient six - inch silicon wa ##fers with which to fabric ##ate chips .
related to that decision , the company said it was converting its santa clara , cal ##if . , factory to a research and development facility .
a spokesman declined to spec ##ulate about possible reductions in force .

so can a magazine survive by down ##right thumb ##ing its nose at major ad ##vert ##iser ##s ?
garbage magazine , billed as ` ` the practical journal for the environment , ' ' is about to find out .
garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a w ##hir ##ling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate america ' s good guys and bad boys .
in one feature , called ` ` in the dump ##ster , ' ' editors point out a product they dee ##m to be a particularly bad offender .
with only two issues under its belt , garbage has alien ##ated some would - be ad ##vert ##iser ##s and raised the ir ##e of others .
` ` it ' s precisely the kind of product that ' s created the municipal landfill monster , ' ' the editors wrote .
he says campbell was n ' t even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment .
modifications had been made to the soup ##er combo product at the time the issue was printed , he says , making it less an offender than was portrayed .
he admits , though , it is n ' t one of campbell soup ' s better products in terms of rec ##y ##cl ##ability .
campbell soup , not surprisingly , does n ' t have any plans to ad ##vert ##ise in the magazine , according to its spokesman .
some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off madison avenue ' s big spend ##ers .

in august , temple sweet ##ened the offer to $ 63 a share , or $ 96 ##3 million .
about $ 490 million of that would be allocated to the buy - back , leaving about $ 130 million , he said .
that $ 130 million , mr . sherwood said , ` ` gives us some flexibility in case temple raises its bid .
we are able to increase our price above the $ 70 level if necessary .
' ' he declined to say , however , how much sea containers might raise its price .

temple also said sea containers ' plan raises ` ` numerous legal , regulatory , financial and fairness issues , ' ' but did n ' t elaborate .
mr . sherwood said reaction to sea containers ' proposal has been ` ` very positive . ' '

the transportation department , responding to pressure from safety advocates , took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles .
the department proposed requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and mini ##van ##s , beginning with 1992 models .
such belts already are required for the vehicles ' front seats .
they say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars .
they did n ' t have much luck during the reagan administration .
` ` we ' re in a very different regulatory environment . ' '
` ` we could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof - crush standards , ' ' he said .
the department ' s roof - crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing 10 , 000 pounds or less .
the roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1 . 5 times the un ##loaded weight of the vehicle .
during the test , the roof could n ' t be depressed more than five inches .
he said chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light - truck line by the sept . 1 , 1991 , deadline .
chrysler said its trucks and vans already meet the roof - crush resistance standard for cars .

the discussions were disclosed as the bank holding company said that it has dropped its long ##standing opposition to full interstate banking bills in connecticut and in massachusetts .
later yesterday , a massachusetts senate committee approved a bill to allow national interstate banking by banks in the state beginning in 1991 .

the price is a new high for california cab ##ern ##et sa ##u ##vi ##gnon , but it is not the highest .
diamond creek 1985 lake vineyard cab ##ern ##et weighed in this fall with a stick ##er price of $ 100 a bottle .
these first magnitude wines ranged in price from $ 40 to $ 125 a bottle .
in the last year or so , however , this exclusive club has taken in a host of flash ##y new members .
france can bo ##ast the lion ' s share of high - priced bottles .
these prices seem rather modest , however , in light of other french wines from current vintage ##s .
in champagne , some of the prestige cu ##ve ##es are inch ##ing toward $ 100 a bottle .
the first champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979 salon de me ##s ##ni ##l blanc de blanc ##s .
the great reds of the rhone valley have soared in price as well .
e . gui ##gal ' s 1982 cote rot ##ie la landon ##ne , for example , is $ 120 .
none of france ' s wine regions can steal a march on burgundy , however .
another small burgundy estate , co ##che - du ##ry , has just offered its 1987 co ##rton - charlemagne for $ 155 .
` ` what ' s different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out .
we ' re seeing it partly because older vintage ##s are growing more scarce . ' '
some of the newer wines , even at $ 90 to $ 100 a bottle or so , almost offer a bargain . ' '
take lake vineyard cab ##ern ##et from diamond creek .
we got our two six - packs - - and they ' re gone . ' '
even if there is consumer resistance at first , a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move .
` ` it ' s just sort of a one - ups ##manship thing with some people , ' ' added larry shapiro .
producers have seen this market opening up and they ' re now creating wines that appeal to these people . ' '
that explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly .
but consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledge ##able than they were a few years ago .
` ` they wo n ' t buy if the quality is not there , ' ' said cedric martin of martin wine cellar in new orleans .
` ` or if they feel the wine is over ##pr ##ice ##d and they can get something equally good for less . ' '
image has , of course , a great deal to do with what sells and what does n ' t , and it ca n ' t be forced .
it ' s interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n ' t always walking out the door .
with the biggest wine - buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach , it will be interesting to see how the super ##pre ##mium ##s fare .
by january it should be fairly clear what ' s hot - - and what ' s not .

bush administration officials are looking to the fed to bring down rates , and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well .
the report from the fed found that manufacturing , in particular , has been weak in recent weeks .
the philadelphia fed , for instance , reported that manufacturing activity ` ` continues to decline ' ' for the fourth month in a row .
and construction also was described as slow in most areas .
despite the economic slow ##down , there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt .
as a result , fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit .
several fed governors in washington have been pushing for easier credit ; but many of the regional fed presidents have been resisting such a move .

georgia gulf re ##bu ##ffed that offer in september and said it would study other alternatives .
however , it has n ' t yet made any proposals to shareholders .
late yesterday , georgia gulf said it reviewed the nl proposal as well as interests from ` ` third parties ' ' regarding business combinations .
` ` he has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull , ' ' says paul le ##ming , a vice president with morgan stanley & co .
` ` he appears to be in it for the long haul . ' '
mr . simmons and nl already own a 9 . 9 % stake in georgia gulf .
mr . simmons owns 88 % of val ##hi inc . , which in turn owns two - thirds of nl .
however , the junk - bond market has collapsed in recent weeks , less ##ening the likelihood that such a transaction would succeed .
now , he said , the group plans to put in ` ` several hundred million ' ' dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt .
in a letter to georgia gulf president jerry r . sat ##rum , mr . martin asked georgia gulf to answer its offer by tuesday .
it was n ' t clear how nl and mr . simmons would respond if georgia gulf spur ##ns them again .
in other transactions , mr . simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer .

criticism in the u . s . over recent japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries ' relations .
where they disagree is on the subject of u . s . direct investment in japan .
the u . s . wants the removal of what it perceive ##s as barriers to investment ; japan denies there are real barriers .
` ` we have a long history of maintaining an open direct - investment policy , ' ' mr . dal ##lar ##a says .
` ` u . s . investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment ' ' in japan .
the japanese fr ##et openly about the u . s . public ' s ran ##cor .
but he has failed to gain any influence at the company .
mr . pick ##ens made considerable political hay with his troubles in japan .
among them are differences in savings and investment rates , corporate structures and management , and government spending .
each side has a lit ##any of recommendations for the other .
the u . s . says it is anxious for results .
both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if ne ##go ##tia ##tors start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed .
but they have n ' t clarified what those might be .
the japanese re ##tort that the first round was too early to make concessions .
` ` just to say the distribution system is wrong does n ' t mean anything , ' ' says a ministry of international trade and industry official .
` ` we need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it . ' '
that process of sorting out specific ##s is likely to take time , the japanese say , no matter how badly the u . s . wants quick results .
for instance , at the first meeting the two sides could n ' t even agree on basic data used in price discussions .
since then , a team of about 15 mit ##i and u . s . commerce department officials have crossed the globe ga ##ug ##ing consumer prices .
by monday , they hope to have a shea ##f of documents both sides can trust .
` ` little by little , there is progress , ' ' says the mit ##i official .
` ` both sides are taking action . ' '
for japan , the controversial trend improves access to american markets and technology .
but for small american companies , it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help .
in a joint - venture deal , mit ##su ##i guided can ##del ##a through tokyo ' s bureau ##cratic maze .
it eventually secured ministry of health import approval for two can ##del ##a laser products - - one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions .
at last count , can ##del ##a had sold $ 4 million of its medical devices in japan .
the deal also gave mit ##su ##i access to a high - tech medical product .
japanese companies have financed small and medium - sized u . s . firms for years , but in recent months , the pace has taken off .
the need ##ham , mass . , concern tracks investments in new businesses .
in addition , of course , some of the japanese investments involved outright purchase of small u . s . firms .
while the small deals are far less conspicuous , they add to japanese penetration of the u . s . market .
as the deals also improve japanese access to american technology and market knowledge , they feed american an ##xie ##ties in this area , too .
even a low - tech product like plate glass can catch a trading company ' s fancy if there ' s a strategic fit .

` ` we want to see the glass market from the inside , not the outside . ' '
mitsubishi ' s investment in free state is ` ` very small . . . less than $ 4 million , ' ' mr . wa ##ku ##i says .
mr . bo ##dner declines to comment on the arrangement .
these vertically integrated combines , some of which got their start in japan ' s feudal period , deal globally in commodities , construction and manufacturing .
a host of electronics firms in california ' s silicon valley were financed with trading - company venture capital .
profit , at least in the short term , is usually a secondary goal .
` ` strategic objectives , not financial return , drive many of the deals , ' ' says a venture economics spokesman .
` ` it ' s the classic problem of the small businessman , ' ' says malcolm davies , managing director of trading alliance corp . of new york .
they want assets , they want a balance sheet , which has no relation to the business a company can generate . ' '
to the extent they can do this , they ' re quite content to get a return on investment of 1 % to 2 % . ' '
sales by these subsidiaries in the fiscal year ending last march were more than $ 17 billion .
a 1 % to 2 % return on $ 17 billion ` ` ai n ' t hay , ' ' mr . klaus ##er says .

for 10 years , genie dr ##isk ##ill went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient .
but in august , first atlanta national bank introduced its crown account , a package designed to lure customers such as ms . dr ##isk ##ill .
among other things , it included checking , safe deposit box and credit card - - all for free - - plus a good deal on installment loans .
all she had to do was put $ 15 , 000 in a certificate of deposit , or qualify for a $ 10 , 000 personal line of credit .
` ` i deserve something for my loyalty , ' ' she says .
so it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days .
for nearly a decade , banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans .
the competitive rates were generally offset by he ##ft ##y fees on various services .
but many banks are turning away from strict price competition .
instead , they are trying to build customer loyalty by bun ##dling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population .
nc ##nb corp . of charlotte , n . c . , recently introduced its financial connections program aimed at young adults just starting careers .
for some time , banks have been aiming packages at the elderly , the demographic segment with the highest savings .
` ` varying age , geography and life - style differences create numerous sub - markets , ' ' ms . macdonald says .
the concept beg ##ot a sl ##ew of copy ##cats , but the banks stopped promoting the packages .
many banks , particularly smaller ones , were slow to computer ##ize and could n ' t target market niche ##s that would have made the programs more profitable .
as banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid - 1970s , the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs .
but now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age , income and geography .
they are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the der ##eg ##ulation that began in the late 1970s .
` ` so people who were n ' t even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base . ' '
the competition has cultivated a much sa ##v ##vier consumer .
` ` this much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today ' s rate - sensitive customers costly . ' '
packages encourage loyalty by reward ##ing customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place .
for their troubles , the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate .
that can pay off down the road as customers , especially the younger ones , change from borrow ##ers to save ##rs \ / investors .
the additional technology , personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive .
` ` it ' s not easy to roll out something that comprehensive , and make it pay , ' ' mr . jacob says .
still , bankers expect packaging to flourish , primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs .
` ` these days , banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them , ' ' ms . moore says .
some banks are already moving in that direction , according to alvin t . sale , marketing director at first union corp . in charlotte .
first union , he says , now has packages for seven customer groups .
currently , shared ##ata has about 4 . 1 million common shares outstanding .
shared ##ata develops and markets low - cost software , peripheral equipment and accessories for computers .
five things you can do for $ 15 , 000 or less :
5 . make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an american savings - and - loan association through the foster corporate parents plan .
americans today spend $ 15 , 000 like pocket change - - they do n ' t think much about it .
your $ 15 , 000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent - - and out of the federal budget deficit .
as a foster corporate parent , you ' ll be helping a neighborhood s & l in areas crucial to its survival .
that builds confidence , self su ##ffi ##ciency , not to mention critical regulatory net worth .
do n ' t wait - - a savings institution needs your help now !
every day you delay , a savings institution ' s health - - and the federal budget deficit - - grows worse .
then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line .
mr . bari ##s is a lawyer in new york .
the chicago mercantile exchange said it plans to institute an additional ` ` circuit breaker ' ' aimed at stemming market slides .
with the limit in effect , members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices , but not below it .
leo mel ##ame ##d , mer ##c executive committee chairman , said that the 12 - point limit appeared to less ##en the selling panic oct . 13 .
all of the changes require regulatory approval , which is expected shortly .
a final modification was made to the five - point opening limit for the contract .
the mer ##c said that five - point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading .
the limit laps ##es under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading .
he said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually .
` ` mark ##ey said we could have done this in public ' ' because so little sensitive information was disclosed , the aide said .
mr . ph ##ela ##n then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel , the aide added .
at another point during the hearing , rep . mark ##ey asked mr . ph ##ela ##n what would be discussed at a new york exchange board meeting today .
mr . ph ##ela ##n said the big board is likely to study the program - trading issue .
mr . ding ##ell expressed concern , sources said , about jurisdiction ##al problems in regulating program trading , which uses futures to offset stock trades .
the futures industry is regulated by the commodity futures trading commission , which reports to the agriculture committees in both houses .
- - dorothy l . say ##ers , ` ` the nine tailor ##s ' '
the parish ##ion ##ers of st . michael and all angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have .
in the tower , five men and women pull rhythmic ##ally on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 161 ##4 .
now , only one local ring ##er remains : 64 - year - old derek hammond .
` ` we ' ve tried to train the young ##sters , but they have their disco ##s and their dances , and they just drift away . ' '
history , after all , is not on his side .
it is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .
then , at a signal , the ring ##ers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking .
each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state .
a series of 5 , 000 or so changes is a ` ` pea ##l ' ' and takes about three hours .
a look at a thursday night practice at st . mary abbot church in the kensington district of london gives an idea of the work involved .
no one speaks , and the s ##na ##king of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .
skilled ring ##ers use their wrists to advance or re ##tar ##d the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .
ring ##ers , she added , are ` ` filled with the solemn into ##xi ##cation that comes of intricate ritual fault ##lessly performed . ' '
it is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however .
more often than not , ring ##ers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the bel ##fr ##y .
this does not sit well with some cleric ##s .
an entirely new band rings today at great tor ##rington , several of whom are members of the congregation .
but there still are n ' t enough ring ##ers to ring more than six of the eight bells .
at st . mary ' s church in il ##minster , somerset , the bells have fallen silent following a dust - up over church attendance .
the vicar , w . d . jones , refuses to talk about it , saying it would ` ` re ##open the wound . ' '
vicar marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell - ring ##er himself .
` ` the sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , ' ' he says .
` ` i live in hopes that the ring ##ers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life . ' '
says mr . baldwin , ` ` we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ' '
mr . baldwin is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ring ##ers .
one survey says that of the 100 , 000 trained bell ##ring ##ers in england today , only 40 , 000 of them still ring .
but the council ' s program to attract and train ring ##ers is only partly successful , says mr . baldwin .
` ` right now , we ' re lucky if after five years we keep one new ring ##er out of 10 , ' ' he adds .
they are n ' t accepted everywhere , however .
i have seen one or two men die , bless them .
investors un ##sett ##led by the stock market ' s g ##yra ##tions can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly divide ##nd checks .
that has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their pay ##outs more than 10 % .
but do n ' t breathe too easy : those divide ##nd increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices , some analysts warn .
in the past , they say , the strongest divide ##nd growth has often come at times when the stock - market party was almost over .
that can be a trap for un ##war ##y investors , says richard bernstein , senior quantitative analyst at merrill lynch & co .
` ` invariably , those strong periods in the economy give way to recession ##ary environments , ' ' he says .
` ` and recession ##ary environments are n ' t ho ##sp ##ita ##ble to the stock market . ' '
indeed , analysts say that pay ##outs have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclic ##al peaks .
that pattern has n ' t always held , but recent strong growth in divide ##nds makes some market watch ##ers anxious .
many people believe the growth in divide ##nds will slow next year , although a minority see double - digit gains continuing .
put another way , the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the divide ##nds they pay , some market analysts say .
they are keeping a close watch on the yield on the s & p 500 .
the figure is currently about 3 . 3 % , up from 3 . 2 % before the recent market slide .
some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3 % .
in fact , ` ` the market has always tank ##ed .
the last time the s & p 500 yield dropped below 3 % was in the summer of 1987 .
stock ##holders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the october de ##ba ##cle .
and in each case , he says , a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year .
still , some market analysts say the current 3 . 3 % reading is n ' t as troubles ##ome as it might have been in years past .
so , while stock prices may look fairly high relative to divide ##nds , they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength .
he factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3 . 6 % .
that is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so , he says .
what will happen to divide ##nd growth next year ?
common wisdom suggests a single - digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits .
the minority argument , meanwhile , is that businesses have the financial where ##with ##al this time around to declare sharply higher divide ##nds even if their earnings weaken .
divide ##nd growth on the order of 12 % is expected by both mr . cox ##on of ci ##gna and mr . ein ##horn of goldman sachs .
those divide ##nd bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying divide ##nds and making capital expenditures .
one indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from standard & poor ' s of the number of public companies adjusting their divide ##nds .
a total of 139 companies raised divide ##nds in october , basically unchanged from 138 a year ago , s & p said wednesday .
that followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year - earlier pace .

it was richard nixon ' s first visit to china in 1972 that set in motion the historic rap ##pro ##che ##ment between beijing and washington .
the chinese , in turn , took aim at american ` ` interference ' ' in china ' s domestic affairs .
one official newspaper , legal daily , even directly criticized mr . nixon , who is normally referred to here as an ` ` old friend . ' '
` ` the events of april through june damaged the respect and confidence which most americans previously had for the leaders of china . ' '
the chinese responded in an equally und ##ip ##lom ##atic fashion .
china was the real victim and it is un ##just to rep ##rove china for it . ' '
in his return toast to mr . nixon , mr . yang said the relationship had reached a ` ` stale ##mate . ' '
mr . nixon is traveling in china as a private citizen , but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the bush administration .
mr . nixon met mr . bush and his national security adviser , brent sc ##ow ##croft , before coming to china on saturday .
and he plans to brief the president at the end of the week , u . s . sources said .
these included china ' s economic policies , human rights and the question of mr . fang .
mr . nixon also proposed that china restore its participation in the fulbright program , a u . s . government - funded academic exchange .
there are no signs , however , of china ' s yielding on key issues .
but in one minor matter , mr . nixon appears to have gained a concession .
but the guards there retained their pistols , and a large contingent of plain ##cloth ##es police remained nearby in unmarked cars .
moreover , police and soldiers continue to hara ##ss americans , who have filed several protests with the foreign ministry in the past week .
several times , chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of u . s . diplomats and clicked the trigger .
they are barking up the wrong tree , because it is basically their fault they ca n ' t attract new employees .
he is just passing the buck to young people .
what ' s wrong with asking for more money ?
money is not everything , but it is necessary , and business is not volunteer work .
it is not une ##thic ##al to choose a higher - sal ##ari ##ed job .
unfortunately , japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages .
i get the impression that some japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful .
i visited a lot of major japanese manufacturers , but i never felt i would want to be employed by any of them .
among professionals , 76 % have a favorable opinion of her , compared to 62 % who approve of her husband ' s performance .

mr . w ##hel ##en denied the firm had sold securities at unfair prices and suggested that the examination practices of the nas ##d need improvement .
the firm and the nas ##d differ over the meaning of mark ##up and mark ##down , he added .
the following individuals were fined as indicated and barred from association with nas ##d members , or , where noted , suspended .
except where noted , none of these people could be reached for comment or had any comment .
the matter ` ` did n ' t involve anybody ' s securities transactions , ' ' he added .

program traders are fond of predicting that if they are blocked in the u . s . , they will simply emi ##grate to foreign stock markets .
but in london and tokyo , where computer - driven trading now plays a small but growing role , traders say a number of hurdles lo ##om .
u . s . stock - index futures are n ' t even traded in japan now .
and because of the time difference , the japanese and the u . s . markets ' trading hours do n ' t overlap .
about 11 . 6 % of all program trading by new york stock exchange firms in september took place in foreign markets , according to big board data .
yet it is difficult to imagine japan racing to introduce chicago - style stock - index futures .
program trading has taken off in japan since last year ' s introduction of home - market stock - index futures trading on the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges .
` ` maybe it was n ' t enough , ' ' a finance ministry official noted after the dec . 7 surge .
japan ' s regulators have since tightened controls on index - related stock purchases .
tokyo ' s leading program traders are the big u . s . securities houses , though the japanese are playing catch - up .
they do n ' t have plans to cut back .
` ` it has not been disrupt ##ive in the markets here , ' ' mr . ma ##ugh ##an said .
the british also are sc ##rut ##ini ##zing program trades .
index - ar ##bit ##rage trading is ` ` something we want to watch closely , ' ' an official at london ' s stock exchange said .
` ` we do n ' t think there is cause for concern at the moment . ' '
london serves increasingly as a con ##du ##it for program trading of u . s . stocks .
first , the trading is done over the counter and is n ' t reported on either the u . s . or london stock trading tapes .
britain has two main index - ar ##bit ##rage instruments .
a financial times - stock exchange 100 - share index option contract is traded on the london stock exchange ' s traded options market .
and an ft - se futures contract is traded on the london international financial futures exchange .
both contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market crash .
the average number of ft - se option contracts traded on the london exchange has surged nearly ten ##fold since the contract ' s launch in 1984 .
this year , the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9 , 118 , up from 4 , 64 ##5 a year earlier and from 91 ##7 in 1984 .
this compares with estimates that the u . s . ` ` derivatives ' ' market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market .
the vote came after a debate rep ##lete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor .
under the measure passed yesterday , the minimum wage would rise to $ 3 . 80 next april .
the senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it .
but ` ` because it ' s all we ' ve got , i ' m going to vote for it . ' '
adopting a training - wage policy means ` ` getting beyond the nickel and dim ##ing of the minimum wage , ' ' mrs . ro ##uke ##ma said .
labor unions and democrats long fought the idea , but recently acc ##eded to it in the face of bush administration insistence .
the training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old .
the white house previously insisted on an unrest ##ricted six - month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job .

for six years , t . marshall hahn jr . has made corporate acquisitions in the george bush mode : kind and gentle .
the question now : can he act more like hard - charging teddy roosevelt ?
so far , mr . hahn is trying to en ##tic ##e ne ##ko ##osa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough .
` ` we are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction , ' ' he says .
but a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war , with all that implies .
he also is a consensus manager , insider ##s say .
associates say mr . hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of virginia polytechnic institute .
but he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand .
in 1970 , mr . hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building .
but mr . hahn rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on .
the son of a physicist , mr . hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates .
he earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the massachusetts institute of technology .
mr . hahn agrees that he has a ` ` re ##ten ##tive ' ' memory , but friends say that ' s an under ##sta ##tem ##ent .
mr . hahn also has engineered a surprising turn ##around of georgia - pacific .
mr . hahn began selling non - core businesses , such as oil and gas and chemicals .
he even sold one unit that made vinyl check ##book covers .
the idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new - home construction .
profit from continuing operations has soared to $ 46 ##7 million from $ 75 million .
mr . hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best .
` ` the record of companies that have diversified is n ' t all that impressive , ' ' he says .
ne ##ko ##osa would n ' t be a divers ##ification .
it would be a good match , mr . hahn and many analysts say , of two healthy companies with high - quality assets and strong cash flows .
the resulting company would be the largest forest - products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ 13 billion .
in this instance , industry observers say , he is entering un ##cha ##rted waters .
says kathryn mca ##ule ##y , an analyst at first manhattan co . : ` ` this is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced .

everyone agrees that most of the nation ' s old bridges need to be repaired or replaced .
but there ' s disagreement over how to do it .
highway officials insist the ornamental railing ##s on older bridges are n ' t strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through .

in richmond , ind . , the type f railing is being used to replace arched openings on the g street bridge .

the new carrier can to ##te as many as four cups at once .
inventor claire marvin says his design virtually eliminate ##s spilling .
he also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers .
a few fast - food outlets are giving it a try .

an exchange of u . s . and soviet designers promises change on both sides .
an exhibition of american design and architecture opened in september in moscow and will travel to eight other soviet cities .
the show runs the ga ##mut , from a blend ##er to chairs to a model of the ci ##tic ##or ##p building .
the event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at carnegie - mellon and leningrad ' s mu ##tch ##in institute .
dan dr ##oz , leader of the carnegie - mellon group , sees benefits all around .
the soviets , who normally have few clients other than the state , will get ` ` exposure to a market system , ' ' he says .
americans will learn more about making products for the soviets .
mr . dr ##oz says the soviets could even help u . s . designers renew their sense of purpose .
` ` they got us thinking maybe we should be helping u . s . companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones . ' '
it ' s a two birds with one stone deal : egg ##ers group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners .
it would ease jail over ##crow ##ding while preserving historic structures , the company says .
but new york state , which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage , says ` ` no . ' '
many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits .
besides , egg ##ers says , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons - - one famed architect compared them to the pyramid ##s of egypt .
a number of cities - - including minneapolis , philadelphia and houston - - have vacant grain elevators , egg ##ers says .
a spokesman for the state , however , calls the idea ` ` not effective or cost efficient .
os ##ha cited nearly 1 , 500 alleged violations of federal electrical , crane - safety , record - keeping and other requirements .
os ##ha said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972 .
a us ##x spokesman said the company had n ' t yet received any documents from os ##ha regarding the penalty or fine .
` ` once we do , they will receive very serious evaluation , ' ' the spokesman said .
` ` no consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees . ' '
us ##x said it has been cooper ##ating with os ##ha since the agency began investigating the clair ##ton and fair ##less works .
he said that , if and when safety problems were identified , they were corrected .
the us ##x citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by os ##ha under mr . scan ##nell .
he has promised stiff ##er fines , though the size of penalties sought by os ##ha have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year .
us ##x has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties , before the independent occupational safety and health review commission .
due to an editing error , a letter to the editor in yesterday ' s edition from frederick h . halle ##tt mistakenly identified the nr ##dc .
it is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholic ##s do not become homeless .
the ` ` causes ' ' of homeless ##ness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case .
in quoting from our research you emphasized the high pre ##val ##ance of mental illness and alcoholism .
you did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .
they suffered from mal ##nut ##rit ##ion , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the after ##ef ##fect ##s of assaults and rape .
homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary nec ##ess ##ities of nutrition , clean ##liness and basic health care .
the interactions between health and homeless ##ness are complex , def ##ying sweeping general ##izations as to ` ` cause ' ' or ` ` effect . ' '
if we look to the future , preventing homeless ##ness is an important objective .

you can even take notes - - extensive notes , for the voice folks wo n ' t look over your shoulder - - about what you read .
you can do all this even if you ' re not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of congress .
and my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts .
until the other day , you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world .
and i apparently had no right to print hit ##her what the voice was booming to yo ##n .
the theory was that the voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n ' t prop ##aga ##ndi ##ze its own people .
that sounds neat , but this government - - any government - - prop ##aga ##ndi ##zes its own people every day .
government press releases , speeches , briefing ##s , tours of military facilities , publications are all propaganda of sorts .
the restrictions on viewing and dissemination of voice material were especially absurd : an agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform .
in june 1988 , i wrote in this space about this issue .
assuming it was n ' t one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door , i ' ll review the facts .
its budget $ 184 million - - is paid for by you .
but a 1948 law barred the ` ` dissemination ' ' of that material in the u . s . .
and , of course , there ' s that word ` ` dissemination . ' '
what if i tune in my short - wave radio , trans ##cr ##ibe an editorial or program , and print it in my newspaper ?
` ` nor are you free to reprint such material , ' ' i was advised .
that sounded a lot like censorship , so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere , i sued .
a couple of weeks ago , i lost the case in federal district court in des moines .
at least , that ' s the way it was reported .
but i - - i like to think of it in terms of we , all of us - - won the point .
- - the us ##ia said that , on reflection , of course i could print anything i could get my hands on .
the word dissemination , it decided , referred only to itself .
- - and the us ##ia said that all of us could take extensive notes .
` ` the first amendment does not pre ##scribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press . ' '
but neither of us can copy the material on a x ##ero ##x machine or have it sent to us .
in an era when every government agency has a public - relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not , this does seem odd .
so the next step , i suspect , is to try to get the law changed .
mr . ga ##rt ##ner is editor and co - owner of the daily tribune in ames , iowa , and president of nbc news in new york .
the board already has been searching for strong outside candidates , including food - industry executives with considerable international experience .
wall street reacted favorably to mr . mc ##go ##vern ' s departure and its implications .
in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange , campbell ' s shares rose $ 3 . 375 to close at $ 47 . 125 .
mr . mc ##go ##vern was widely seen as sales , and not profit , oriented .
` ` new managers would think a little more like wall street , ' ' mr . mc ##mill ##in added .
campbell ' s international businesses , particularly in the u . k . and italy , appear to be at the heart of its problems .
growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in u . s . units .
however , neither mr . ba ##um nor mr . harper has much international experience .
mr . harper , a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined campbell in 1986 , will take charge of all overseas operations as well as pepper ##idge .
in an joint interview yesterday , both men said they would like to be the company ' s next chief executive .
in recent months , mr . do ##rran ##ce ' s children and other family members have pushed for improved profit ##ability and higher returns on their equity .
in august , the company took a $ 343 million pre ##ta ##x charge against fiscal 1989 earnings when it announced a world - wide restructuring plan .
the plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about 3 , 600 jobs .
but analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing , especially in europe , and there were signs that the board became impatient .
campbell officials said mr . mc ##go ##vern was n ' t available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure .
but people familiar with the agenda of the board ' s meeting last week in london said mr . mc ##go ##vern was fired .
for fiscal 1989 , mr . mc ##go ##vern received a salary of $ 87 ##7 , 66 ##3 .
he owns about 45 , 000 shares of campbell stock and has options to buy more than 100 , 000 additional shares .
he will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $ 244 , 000 with certain other fringe benefits .
mr . ba ##um said he and mr . harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988 .
` ` you ' ve got to make the restructuring work , ' ' said mr . ba ##um .
` ` you ' ve got to make those savings now . ' '
mr . harper expressed confidence that he and mr . ba ##um can convince the board of their worth ##iness to run the company .
` ` we look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team , ' ' he said .
he predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive .
in the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon , both men ex ##uded confidence and seemed to work well together .
` ` you ' ve got two champions sitting right before you , ' ' said mr . ba ##um .

robert l . bernstein , chairman and president of random house inc . , announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years .
abrupt departure ##s are n ' t un ##heard of within the new ##house empire .
he declined to elaborate , other than to say , ` ` it just seemed the right thing to do at this minute .
sometimes you just go with your gut . ' '
mr . bernstein said he will stay until dec . 31 and work with his successor , who is to be named soon .
the company said the publisher ' s annual sales volume increased to $ 800 million from $ 40 million during mr . bernstein ' s tenure .
` ` bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliant ##ly , ' ' said mr . new ##house .
` ` the company is doing well , it ' s stable , it ' s got good people .

crown publishing group , acquired last year , is said to be turning in disappointing results .
as a private company , random house does n ' t report its earnings .
mr . bernstein , who succeeded bennett ce ##rf , has been only the second president of random house since it was founded in 1925 .
speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house .
some say anthony che ##eth ##am , head of a recently acquired british company , century hutchinson , could be chosen .
mr . me ##hta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less - than - brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently .
this phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through congress .
this species of congressional action is pre ##dicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is er ##rone ##ous and unconstitutional .
the appropriations clause states that ` ` no money shall be drawn from the treasury , but in consequence of appropriations made by law . . . . ' '
this interpretation was officially endorsed by congress in 1987 in the iran - contra report .
it is not supported by the text or history of the constitution .
the frame ##rs hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the constitutional convention of 1787 , according to madison ' s notes .
to the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability .
the 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by article ii .
thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , congress repeal ##s the president ' s power to make recess appointments under article ii .
section 60 ##5 also impose ##s unconstitutional conditions on the president ' s ability to nominate candidates of his choosing .
the president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the anti - deficiency act prohibits voluntary service to the government .
the 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of ` ` mu ##zzling ' ' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in article ii of the constitution .
there is something inherently suspect about congress ' s prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .
the supreme court ' s decision in ins v . chad ##ha held that legislative veto ##es are unconstitutional .
what becomes custom in the bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents , including democrats , to undo .
the constitution does not express ##ly give the president such power .
however , the president does have a duty not to violate the constitution .
the question is whether his only means of defense is the veto .
the ex ##cision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited app ##lica ##bility .
there is no downs ##ide if the president asserts a right of ex ##cision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .
if congress does nothing , president bush will have won .
if congress takes the dispute to the supreme court - l ##rb - assuming it can establish standing to sue - rr ##b - , president bush might win .
if president bush loses at the court , it might be disappointing , as morrison v . olson was for the reagan administration .
but the presidency would be no worse off than it is now .
moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civic ##s lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice .
as it stands now , congress pre ##sume ##s after the reagan administration that the white house will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down .
mr . sid ##ak served as an attorney in the reagan administration .
his longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the duke law journal later this year .
the previous record was $ 57 . 7 billion in 1987 , according to the agriculture department .
the worst crop damage occurred in the midwest ##ern corn belt and the northern great plains .
with prices soaring , they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at ` ` considerable profit , ' ' the agency ' s 240 - page report said .
in less parc ##hed areas , meanwhile , farmers who had little or no loss of production profit ##ed greatly from the higher prices .
analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ 4 billion disaster - assistance package enacted by congress .
last year ' s record net cash income confirms the farm sector ' s rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s .
it also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lo ##bbies and many law ##makers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year .
at the same time , export demand for u . s . wheat , corn and other commodities strengthened , said keith collins , a department analyst .
farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices , as the nation ' s cattle inventory dropped close to a 30 - year low .
` ` all of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture , ' ' mr . collins said .
iowa and minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income .
department economists do n ' t expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was .
indeed , net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline .
last year , government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ 14 . 5 billion from a record $ 16 . 7 billion in 1987 .
payments are expected to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion this year .

the prospective buyers included investor marvin davis and the toronto sun .
the death of the herald , a news ##stand paper in a freeway town , was perhaps inevitable .
hearst had flirt ##ed with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan .
many felt hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did , if marginal ##ly , because of its place in family history .
its fan ##ciful offices were designed by architect julia morgan , who built the hearst castle at san simeon .
william randolph hearst had kept an apartment in the spanish renaissance - style building .
analysts said the herald ' s demise does n ' t necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry .
` ` actually , the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end , and the industry looks pretty healthy . ' '
financially , it never recovered ; editorial ##ly , it had its moments .
in 1979 , hearst hired editor james bell ##ows , who brightened the editorial product considerably .
for example , the herald consistently beat its much - larger rival on disclosure ##s about los angeles mayor tom bradley ' s financial dealings .
the herald ' s sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded .
hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days .
some long - tenure ##d employees will receive additional benefits , the company said .
hours after the announcement , representatives of the orange county register were in a bar across the street recruiting .
` ` i ' ve never seen so many people crying in one place at one time , ' ' said bill johnson , an assistant city editor .
` ` so long , l . a . ' ' was chosen as the paper ' s final headline .
his wife also works for the paper , as did his father .
` ` forget it , ' ' he said as he handed her a paper .
` ` it does n ' t make any difference now .
the radio - station owner and programmer said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lend ##ers and other financial institutions .
it said it needs to make the payment by dec . 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt .
in september , the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business .
if you ' d really rather have a buick , do n ' t leave home without the american express card .
the companies are giving four - day vacation ##s for two to buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the american express green card .
they have begun sending letters explaining the program , which began oct . 18 and will end dec . 18 , to about five million card holders .
neither company would disclose the program ' s cost .
american express also represents the upscale image ` ` we ' re trying to project , ' ' she adds .
sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier , though industry sales fell .
but since the 1990 model year began oct . 1 , buick sales have plunged 33 % .
traditionally , the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses .
to that end , american express has been signing up gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers to accept the card .
in addition , buick is a relatively respected name ##plate among american express card holders , says an american express spoke ##sw ##oman .
american express has more than 24 million card holders in the u . s . , and over half have the green card .
some 3 . 8 million of the five million who will get letters were pre ##app ##roved for credit with gma ##c .
the vacation packages include hotel accommodations and , in some cases , tours or tickets to local attractions , but not meals .
a buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion ' s ticket free if they fly on united airlines .
in lieu of the vacation , buyers can choose among several prizes , including a grandfather clock or a stereo video ##cas ##sett ##e recorder .
card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweeps ##take ##s with buick cars or a hawaii vacation as prizes .
if they test - drive a buick , they get an american express cal ##cula ##tor .
this is n ' t buick ' s first travel - related promotion .
a few years ago , the company offered two round - trip tickets on trans world airlines to buyers of its ri ##vier ##a luxury car .
the promotion helped ri ##vier ##a sales exceed the division ' s forecast by more than 10 % , buick said at the time .
the united kingdom high court declared illegal a variety of interest - rate swap transactions and options deals between a london borough council and commercial banks .
the ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the london borough of hammersmith and fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions .
in response to the ruling , gil ##t futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session .
at one point , hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 % of the sterling market in interest - rate swap dealings .
when two parties engage in an interest - rate swap , they are betting against each other on future rates .
thus , an institution ob ##liga ##ted to make fixed - rate interest payments on debt swap ##s the payments with another making floating - rate payments .
in most of the british transactions , the municipalities agreed to make floating - rate payments to banks , which would make fixed - rate payments .
as interest rates rose , municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them .
the council backed the audit commission ' s stand that the swap transactions are illegal .
already , 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swap ##s dealings .
banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils .
officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable .
the banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly .
but the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market .
the real battle is over who will control that market and re ##ap its huge rewards .
a few , such as giant merrill lynch & co . , now refuse even to do index ar ##bit ##rage trades for clients .
` ` they said universally , without a single exception : do n ' t even compromise .
wall street ' s new guard is n ' t likely to take all this lying down for long , however .
its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable .
even some members of the old guard , despite their current advantage , seem to be con ##ced ##ing that the future belongs with the new guard .
last week , robert m . bradley , one of the big board ' s most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization , surrendered .
he said the exchange is ` ` headed for a real crisis ' ' if program trading is n ' t curb ##ed .
` ` i do not want my money invested in what i consider as nothing more than a casino , ' ' mr . bradley wrote .
the battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations , causing internal contradiction ##s and pitt ##ing employee against employee .
the big board - - the nation ' s premier stock exchange - - is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives .
its en ##tre ##nched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs .
` ` a lot of people would like to go back to 1970 , ' ' before program trading , mr . ph ##ela ##n said this week .
` ` i would like to go back to 1970 .
but we are not going back to 1970 . ' '
again and again , program - trading ' s critics raise the ` ` casino ' ' theme .
the program traders , on the other hand , portray old - fashioned stock pick ##ers as the ne ##ander ##thal ##s of the industry .
` ` just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection . ' '
that diver ##gence is what stock index traders seek .
such program trades , which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock , occur in a matter of seconds .
a program trade of $ 5 million of stock typically earn ##s a razor - thin profit of $ 25 , 000 .
to keep program - trading units profitable in the eyes of senior broker ##age executives , traders must seize every opportunity their computers find .
the speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics prof ##ess to des ##pis ##e .
but many experts and traders say that program trading is n ' t the main reason for stock - market g ##yra ##tions .
says the big board ' s mr . ph ##ela ##n , ` ` vol ##ati ##lity is greater than program trading . ' '
while program trades swiftly kicked in , a ` ` circuit breaker ' ' that halted trading in stock futures in chicago made some program trading impossible .
take the traditional money managers , or ` ` stock pick ##ers , ' ' as they are der ##isi ##vel ##y known among the computer jockey ##s .
traditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $ 100 they manage for big institutional investors , and higher fees for smaller investors .
yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with , much less beat , the returns of standard bench ##marks like the s & p
the index ##ers charge only a few penn ##ies per $ 100 managed .
today , about $ 200 billion , or 20 % of all pension - fund stock investments , is held by index funds .
the new wall street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 big board stock - specialist firms .
the specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death kn ##ell .
and they believe the big board , under mr . ph ##ela ##n , has abandoned their interest .
meanwhile , specialists ' trading risks have sky ##rock ##ete ##d as a result of stock - market vol ##ati ##lity .
no one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation ' s stock ##bro ##kers .
they are still trying to lure back small investors sp ##ook ##ed by the 1987 stock - market crash and the market ' s swings since then .
stock ##bro ##kers ' business and pay has been falling .
last year , the average broker earned $ 71 , 309 , 24 % lower than in 1987 .
corporate executives res ##ent that their company ' s stock has been transformed into a name ##less piece of a stock - index basket .
` ` do you make sweatshirt ##s or spark ##pl ##ug ##s ?
oh , you ' re in the paper business , ' ' is one reaction mr . si ##gler says he ' s gotten from his big institutional shareholders .
by this september , program traders were doing a record 13 . 8 % of the big board ' s average daily trading volume .
but then came oct . 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the old guard , particularly against index ar ##bit ##rage .
the index ##ers ' strategy for the moment is to hu ##nk ##er down and let the fur ##or die .
` ` there ' s a lynch - mob psychology right now , ' ' says the top program - trading official at a wall street firm .
too much money is at stake for program traders to give up .
for example , stock - index futures began trading in chicago in 1982 , and within two years they were the fastest - growing futures contract ever launched .
stock futures trading has mint ##ed dozens of millionaire ##s in their 20s and 30 ##s .
now , on a good day , chicago ' s stock - index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the big board trades in stock .
now the stage is set for the battle to play out .
the anti - programmers are getting some helpful thunder from congress .
` ` we have to have a system that says to those largest investors :
you will not put the financial system in jeopardy . ' ' '
but the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon .
many people , including the big board , think that it ' s too late to put the genie back in the bottle .
program trading is here to stay , and computers are here to stay , and we just need to understand it . ' '
program trading critics also want the federal reserve board , rather than the futures industry , to set such margins .
futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active .
higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell , they say .
the big board ' s up ##tick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price .
a reins ##tate ##ment of the up ##tick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably .
program traders argue that a reins ##tate ##ment of the rule would destroy the ` ` pricing efficiency ' ' of the futures and stock markets .
big board chairman john ph ##ela ##n said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock - price swings .
thus the band - wagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus .
index ar ##bit ##rage is a common form of program trading .
that represents a very thin ` ` excess ' ' return , certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pick ##ers claim to seek as their performance objective .
the fact that a vast majority of fundamental ##ist money managers fail to beat the s & p 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue .
as more managers pursue the index - ar ##bit ##rage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated .
but many of these reforms are un ##nee ##ded , even harmful .
an index - ar ##bit ##rage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in new york and chicago to cover all transaction costs .
ar ##bit ##rage does n ' t cause vol ##ati ##lity ; it responds to it .
a large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures .
ar ##bit ##rage simply transfers his selling pressure from chicago to new york , while functioning as a buyer in chicago .
the start of the whole process is the key - someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in wi ##dgets to make wi ##dget prices move .
why does this large hypothetical seller trade in chicago instead of new york ?
perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the ar ##bit ##rage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade .
if not chicago , then in new york ; if not the u . s . , then overseas .
eliminate ar ##bit ##rage and liquid ##ity will decline instead of rising , creating more vol ##ati ##lity instead of less .
the speed of his transaction is n ' t to be feared either , because faster and cleaner execution is desirable , not lo ##ath ##some .
if slowing things down could reduce vol ##ati ##lity , stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future .
we must be very cautious about labeling investors as ` ` long - term ' ' or ` ` short - term . ' '
the ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive , and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term .
a free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquid ##ity and risks he can tolerate .
could rising vol ##ati ##lity possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program - trading goblin ##s ?
some of the proposed fix ##es for what is labeled ` ` program - trading vol ##ati ##lity ' ' could be far worse than the perceived problem .
they may , however , risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves .
how does a nice new tax , say 5 % , on any financial transaction sound ?
that ought to make sure we ' re all thinking for the long term .
the loud ##est of these reformer ##s are money managers who cater to smaller investors .
they continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell , while their clients continue to hope for superior performance .
yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studio ##usly dev ##ouring press clip ##ping ##s on each company he follows .
almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy , and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences .
if spreads available from index ar ##bit ##rage are so enormous , surely any sizable mutual - fund company could profit from offering it to small investors .
each new trading road ##block is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high - volume clients , here or overseas .
leg ##is ##lating new trading in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##ncies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors .
left to its own devices , index ar ##bit ##rage will become more and more efficient , making it harder and harder to do profit ##ably .
instead , we ought to be inviting more liquid ##ity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants .

although his team lost the world series , san francisco giants owner bob lu ##rie hopes to have a new home for them .
he is an avid fan of a proposition on next week ' s ballot to help build a replacement for candles ##tick park .
small wonder , since he ' s asking san francisco taxpayers to sink up to $ 100 million into the new stadium .
as san francisco dig ##s out from the pretty big one , opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium .
a stadium cr ##az ##e is sweeping the country .
it ' s fueled by the increasing profit ##ability of major - league teams .
something like one - third of the nation ' s 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums , ranging from cleveland to san antonio and st . petersburg .
most booster ##s claim the new sports complexes will be money ##makers for their city .
pepper ##dine university economist dean bai ##m sc ##offs at that .
stadiums tend to red ##ist ##ri ##bu ##te existing wealth within a community , not create more of it .
voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega - stadium .
san francisco voters rejected a new ball ##park two years ago .
last month , phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition .
but voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself , and rejected it 59 % to 41 % .
in san francisco , its back ##ers con ##cede the ball ##park is at best running even in the polls .
he says he had candles ##tick built because the giants claimed they needed 10 , 000 parking spaces .
stadium booster ##s claim that without public money they would never be built .
miami dolphins owner joe robbie disagree ##s , and he can prove it .
he did n ' t see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit .
` ` this stadium shows that anything government can do , we can do better , ' ' mr . robbie says .
` ` the super ##dome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , ' ' he has said .
` ` it is the very building of it that is important , not how much of it is used or its economics . ' '

wall street ' s big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered .
the reason : risks from the firms ' new ` ` merchant banking ' ' activities are rising as revenue from the industry ' s traditional business er ##odes .
securities firms are among the biggest issue ##rs of commercial paper , or short - term corporate io ##us , which they sell to finance their daily operations .
the biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper .
shear ##son is 62 % - owned by american express co .
` ` a sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . ' '
that ' s a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors .
` ` wall street is facing a catch - 22 situation , ' ' says mr . ma ##hone ##y of moody ' s .
merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , ` ` is getting risk ##ier , and there ' s less of it to go around . ' '
it said that the ` ` temptation for management ##s to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor . ' '
` ` these two exposure ##s alone represent a very substantial portion of cs first boston ' s equity , ' ' moody ' s said .
` ` total merchant banking exposure ##s are in excess of the firm ' s equity . ' '
cs first boston , however , benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder , credit sui ##sse , switzerland ' s third largest bank .
shear ##son also has been an aggressive participant in the leverage ##d buy - out business .
shear ##son ` ` really only has $ 300 million of capital , ' ' says mr . bowman of s & p .

recently , dr ##ex ##el circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years .
the firm ' s capital , moreover , has n ' t grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say .
dr ##ex ##el remains confident of its future credit ##worth ##iness .
` ` we ' re well positioned with $ 1 . 7 billion of capital , ' ' a dr ##ex ##el spokesman said .
moreover , we ' ve probably been the most aggressive firm on the street in reducing costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months .
most recently , mr . vera ##ld ##i , 59 years old , has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at ford motor co .
the concept ' s goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make ford ' s product development more responsive to consumer demands .
it was later applied to other new - car programs , including those that produced the ford thunder ##bird and mercury co ##uga ##r .
mr . vera ##ld ##i worked at ford for 40 years , holding a variety of car and parts - engineering positions .
we can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of solomon ##ic aid to those who ' ve been hurt .
too often now , a single court decision becomes the precedent for other , less compelling cases .
the drug was approved by the food and drug administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies , often under generic labels .
in the 1970s , scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of des users .
the cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand des plaintiffs could n ' t recall whose brand they used .
drug makers should n ' t be able to duck liability because people could n ' t identify precisely which identical drug was used .
just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that des defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warrant ##ies .
the big problem , however , is that there ' s no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to des or to drugs .
the problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine .
the court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs , citing the huge , hidden social costs .
this raises the key issue : what to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ?
des daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts .
congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs .
but a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children ' s vaccines with a compensation fund has predict ##ably led to even more litigation .
everyone by now understands that congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help des ##erving people without its becoming some billion - dollar mora ##ss .
we have no doubt this is one reason judges in new york and justices on the supreme court are willing to trash the law in the des cases .
they must figure that justice has to get done by somebody , but know it wo n ' t be done by congress .
may stores , st . louis , runs such well - known department stores as lord & taylor .
the charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company ' s construction division .
last year , ds ##m had 71 million guild ##ers of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions .
the earnings growth also was fueled by the company ' s ability to cut net financing spending by half to around 15 million guild ##ers .
also , substantially lower dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax out ##lay flat relative to earnings growth , the company added .
sales , however , were little changed at 2 . 46 billion guild ##ers , compared with 2 . 42 billion guild ##ers .

the committee ' s members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of poland ' s own farmers .
rep . gary ac ##ker ##man noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in el salvador and egypt .

bears have targeted columbia ' s stock because of the th ##rift ' s exposure to the shaky junk market .
that ' s almost $ 10 of equity for each columbia share , including convertible preferred shares , though more junk mark ##down ##s would reduce the cushion .
columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands .
the sp ##ieg ##el family has 25 % of the common and 75 % of the votes .
other big common holders are carl lin ##dner ' s american financial , investor irwin jacobs and pacific financial research , though the latter cut its stake this summer .
indeed , columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold columbia ' s junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking .
columbia wo n ' t comment on all the speculation .
but like other th ##rift ##s , it ' s expected to seek regulators ' consent to create a distinct junk - bond entity .
plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so .
new rules force th ##rift ##s to write down their junk to market value , then sell the bonds over five years .
that ' s why columbia just wrote off $ 130 million of its junk and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses .
columbia , a longtime dr ##ex ##el client , wo n ' t provide current data on its junk .
but its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered .
possibly offset ##ting that , columbia recently estimated it has un ##real ##ized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million .
it also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million on equity investments in buy - outs and restructuring ##s .
the th ##rift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity , financial industry executives say .
it is n ' t clear how much a restructuring would help columbia stock ##holders .
mr . sp ##ieg ##el ' s next career move is a subject of speculation on wall street .
few people think mr . sp ##ieg ##el wants to run a bread - and - butter th ##rift , which current rules would force columbia to become .
` ` they are n ' t really a th ##rift , ' ' says jonathan gray , a sanford c . bernstein analyst .
of course , regulators would have to approve columbia ' s reorganization .

the program , available to up ##jo ##hn employees 55 years old or older , could increase an individual ' s retirement benefits 10 % to 20 % .
in addition , up ##jo ##hn is offering a one - time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay .
but some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have , because few jobs will end up being eliminated .
` ` it ' s a cosmetic move , ' ' said jonathan s . gel ##les of we ##rth ##eim sc ##hr ##oder & co .
according to up ##jo ##hn ' s estimates , only 50 % to 60 % of the 1 , 100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan .
up ##jo ##hn further estimated that about 50 % of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced .
as a result , up ##jo ##hn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21 , 000 jobs world - wide .

many grain processors and export ##ers use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers .

some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry ' s problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts - - only to see little appreciation .

in the 1988 period , us ##x also had a $ 71 million after - tax gain from a tax dispute settlement .
sales rose 5 % to $ 4 . 4 billion from $ 4 . 2 billion .
however , third - quarter operating profit fell 14 % , as us ##x sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations .
moreover , us ##x exports more than other steel ##makers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure .
in the steel division , operating profit dropped 11 % to $ 85 million .
the rise in the stock ' s price may also reflect the fact that us ##x ' s steel segment fare ##d better than some other steel ##makers ' .
the energy segment , with a 15 % rise in operating profit , is clearly the company ' s strongest .

investors are appealing to the securities and exchange commission not to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate insider ##s .
the proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often .
` ` apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal . ' '
but about 25 % of the insider ##s , according to sec figures , file their reports late .
the sec will probably vote on the proposal early next year , he said .
according to some estimates , the rule changes would cut insider filing ##s by more than a third .
the sec ' s mr . lane ve ##hem ##ently disputed those estimates .
the rules will eliminate filing ##s policy - making divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and development , mr . lane said .
the proposed rules also would be tough ##er on the insider ##s still required to file reports , he said .
companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insider ##s who fail to file reports on time .
many investors wrote asking the sec to require insider ##s to report their purchases and sales immediately , not a month later .
but mr . lane said that while the sec regulates who files , the law tells them when to do so .
investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in congress , he added .
the sec would likely be am ##ena ##ble to legislation that required insider ##s to file transactions on a more timely basis , he said .

the position of the united states , which once contributed 25 % of the budget , is that nothing has changed .
other countries , including west germany , may have a hard time justify ##ing continued membership .
we see an even stronger argument against unesco than its un ##sur ##pr ##ising failure to reform .

researchers at plant genetic systems n . v . in belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops .
the researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of pollen .
the gene thus can prevent a plant from fe ##rti ##li ##zing itself .
such so - called male - sterile plants can then be fe ##rti ##lized by pollen from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed .
on a commercial scale , the ste ##ril ##ization of the pollen - producing male part has only been achieved in corn and so ##rgh ##um feed grains .
that ' s because the male part , the ta ##ssel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant .
in a labor - intensive process , the seed companies cut off the ta ##ssel ##s of each plant , making it male sterile .
they so ##w a row of male - fertile plants nearby , which then poll ##inate the male - sterile plants .
the vast majority of the u . s . corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies .
a similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops , such as cotton , soy ##be ##ans and rice .
the ant ##hers in these plants are difficult to clip off .
at plant genetic systems , researchers have isolated a pollen - inhibit ##ing gene that can be inserted in a plant to con ##fer male ste ##ril ##ity .
mr . lee ##mans said this genetic manipulation does n ' t hurt the growth of that plant .
the researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male - sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop .
they attached a second gene , for herb ##icide resistance , to the pollen - inhibit ##ing gene .
both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants , which are then poll ##inated and allowed to mature and produce seed .
mr . lee ##mans said the hybrid rape ##see ##ds created with this genetic engineering yield 15 % to 30 % more output than the commercial strains used currently .
he said the company is experimenting with the technique on alfa ##lf ##a , and plans to include cotton and corn , among other crops .
one technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant ' s pollen .
this gene , called ` ` game ##to ##cide , ' ' is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days .
` ` there is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds , ' ' he said .
` ` it ' s one thing to say you can ste ##ril ##ize , and another to then successfully poll ##inate the plant , ' ' he said .
nevertheless , he said , he is negotiating with plant genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton .
the clash is a sign of a new tough ##ness and di ##vis ##ive ##ness in japan ' s once - cozy financial circles .
already , the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets - - even governments .
what triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a new zealand government bond issue .
the dispute shows clearly the global power of japan ' s financial titans .
aside from no ##mura ' s injured pride , the biggest victim so far has been the new zealand government .

jaguar shares sky ##rock ##ete ##d yesterday after mr . ridley ' s announcement , following their temporary suspension on london ' s stock exchange .
such a proposal values jaguar at more than # 1 . 6 billion - l ##rb - $ 2 . 53 billion - rr ##b - .
speculation about a takeover fight has sent jaguar shares soaring in the past six weeks .
the share price was lang ##uis ##hing at about 400 pen ##ce before ford ' s sept . 19 announcement of its interest in a minority stake .
ford is ` ` in the driving seat at the moment , ' ' observed bob barber , an auto analyst at broker ##s james cape ##l & co .
an aggressive ford bid for jaguar would put pressure on gm to make a better offer as the british company ' s ` ` white knight . ' '
such a counter ##mo ##ve could end jaguar ' s hopes for remaining independent and british - owned .
but it is n ' t clear how long gm would be willing to fight ford for jaguar .
people close to the gm - jaguar talks agreed that ford now may be able to shut out general motors .
` ` it ' s either going to be a shootout , or there only may be one player in town , ' ' one person said .
the statement emphasized that holders representing 75 % of the shares voting at a special shareholders ' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions .
jaguar officials in the u . s . noted that ford , as jaguar ' s largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting .
jaguar ' s own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and management .
ford officials in the u . s . declined to comment on the british government ' s action or on any plans to call a special jaguar shareholders meeting .
indeed , the government is taking a calculated risk .
the british government retained the single golden share after selling its stake in jaguar in

yields on savings - type certificates of deposit dropped slightly in the week ended yesterday .
` ` this week was uneven ##tf ##ul for the cd market , ' ' said nor ##berto me ##hl , chairman of ban ##x ##qu ##ote .
` ` the major banks have n ' t even reacted to sharp rises in the three - month treasury bill rates ' ' in the past two weeks .
banks that adjusted pay ##outs on cds in the most recent week made only fraction ##al moves , he said .
the cd trend runs counter to the direction of short - term interest rates at the treasury bill auction monday .
the average six - month bill was sold with a yield of 8 . 04 % , up from 7 . 90 % .
the average three - month issue rose to 8 . 05 % from 7 . 77 % .
but when market interest rates move up rapidly , increases in bank cd yields sometimes la ##g .
most yields on short - term ju ##mbo cds , those with denominations over $ 90 , 000 , also moved in the opposite direction of treasury bill yields .
for longer - term cds , yields were up .
however , cds sold through major broker - dealer networks were up slightly almost across the board .
the average six - month cd in that category added 0 . 05 percentage point to 8 . 35 % , for example .
mr . me ##hl attributed the rise specifically to the treasury bill increase .
among the major banks surveyed by ban ##x ##qu ##ote in six regions of the country , 8 . 33 % is the highest yield available .
it is offered by the flagship banks of new york ' s manufacturers hanover corp . in the one - year maturity only .
the yield is offered across a range of mat ##urities at san francisco ' s bank ##ame ##rica corp . and wells fargo & co .

the venture would be the latest in coke ' s rapid expansion of overseas investment .
so far this year , it has put nearly $ 700 million into bot ##tling operations in australia , new zealand and france .
the move also reflects coke ' s eager ##ness to have a hand in developing the soft - drink markets in pacific basin countries .

the move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses , which include ceramic tile , floor covering ##s and furniture .
analysts expect armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt , buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition .
the carpet division had 1988 sales of $ 36 ##8 . 3 million , or almost 14 % of armstrong ' s $ 2 . 68 billion total revenue .
recently it upgraded its plants so that it could make stain - resistant products with higher quality dye ##s .
armstrong ' s shares , also listed on the big board , closed at $ 39 . 125 , up 12 . 5 cents .
for the quarter , earnings were $ 47 million , or 92 cents a share , including a one - time gain of $ 5 . 9 million .
in the year - ago quarter , earnings were $ 42 . 9 million , or 93 cents a share .
yesterday , armstrong announced an agreement to sell its small applied color systems unit to a subsidiary of the swiss company , bra ##uer ##ei e ##ich ##of ltd .
however , it does n ' t give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon .
so far this year , the index of leading indicators has risen in four months , fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month .
the declines were particularly pronounced in the northeast and in the south , where hurricane hugo was a factor .
the department also said it takes four months to establish a trend .
so far this year , 53 ##4 , 000 newly built homes have been sold , down 4 . 5 % from the like months of 1988 .
the index of leading indicators got a major boost in september from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the university of michigan .
the commerce department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index , the influence of this component has been reduced .
of the 11 components to the index , only three others rose in september : the money supply , the length of the average work week and stock prices .
several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in september .
the remainder expect a down ##turn to begin sometime in
the other 40 % said the fed ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down .
all the figures are adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns .
here are the net contributions of the components of the commerce department ' s index of leading indicators .
after various adjustments , they produced a 0 . 5 % rise in the index for august and a 0 . 2 % rise for september .
september , and the change from august , are : from 1 . 11 in the previous month .
boston edison co . said it will take a previously reported $ 60 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter .

the new mi ##ps machine , called the rc ##6 ##28 ##0 , will cost $ 150 , 000 for a basic system .
the computer processes 55 million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip , unlike many rival machines using several processors .
the machine employs reduced instruction - set computing , or ri ##sc , technology .
at that price , an analyst familiar with the machine said , the computer offers up to 10 times the performance of similar machines .
the machine is part of an effort by mi ##ps to establish itself as a supplier of computers , not just of integrated - circuit technology .
` ` this clearly demonstrates that mi ##ps is a systems company rather than just a chip company , ' ' said mi ##ps vice president john him ##e .
ri ##sc technology speeds up a computer by sim ##plify ##ing the internal software .
` ` they ' re getting some major wins , ' ' she added .
last month , for example , mi ##ps agreed to supply its computers to nix ##dorf computer ag of west germany and france ' s group ##e bull .
the machine is essentially a main ##frame computer , he said .
nix ##dorf , bull and others will also sell versions of the machine , said mi ##ps president robert miller .
mi ##ps will start shipping its new machine in the first quarter of 1990 , he said .
the machine uses a single processor , which makes it easier to program than competing machines using several processors .
the computer can process 13 . 3 million calculations called floating - point operations every second .
the machine can run software written for other mi ##ps computers , the company said .

the rt ##c will have to sell or merge hundreds of ins ##ol ##vent th ##rift ##s over the next three years .
in the meantime , the agency must raise cash to maintain assets , such as real estate , until they can be sold .
then the short - term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets .

mr . holland ##er was named chairman last week , succeeding mr . week ##es , who was among the ousted directors .
the company has declined requests to discuss the changes , but mr . week ##es has said that mr . holland ##er wanted to have his own team .
scott wake ##man was named president and chief operating officer of u . s . operations , titles that had been held by mr . week ##es .
mr . wake ##man was vice president of the instrument and controls division of closely held omega engineering inc . , another company controlled by mr . holland ##er .

as the judge marched down the center aisle in his flowing black robe , he was herald ##ed by a trumpet fan ##fare .
to many , it was a ceremony more be ##fi ##tting a king than a rural judge seated in the isolated foothills of the southern allegheny mountains .
but then judge o ' kick ##i often behaved like a man who would be king - - and , some say , an arrogant and abusive one .
while his case may be extreme , it reflects the vulnerability of many small communities to dom ##ine ##ering judges .
the allegations , ranging from theft and bribery to coe ##rc ##ion and lew ##d ##ness , paint a di ##s ##qui ##eti ##ng picture .
one secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all .
` ` i do n ' t know whose toes i ' ve stepped on , ' ' says the judge .
` ` i ' ll find out , eventually , who pushed the state police buttons into action . ' '
even if only some of the allegations stand up , however , they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities .
that power can sometimes be abused , particularly since jurist ##s in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as correct ##ive measures in urban areas .
lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year .
judge o ' kick ##i , a stern and forbid ##ding - looking man , has been a fixture in the local legal community for more than two decades .
it was also in law school that mr . o ' kick ##i and his first wife had the first of seven daughters .
he divorced his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk .
clearly , the judge has had his share of accomplishments .
after practicing law locally , he was elected to his first 10 - year term as judge in 1971 ; in 1981 , he was effectively re - elected .
six years ago , judge o ' kick ##i was voted president of the pennsylvania conference of state trial judges by the state ' s 400 judges .
he has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court va ##can ##cies in pennsylvania .
` ` he ' s sharp as a tack .
he could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye . ' '
for more than a decade , virtually no one complained about judge o ' kick ##i .
` ` nobody told us ; nobody called us , ' ' says an official close to the case who asked not to be named .
` ` nobody had the guts to complain . ' '
` ` the judge never made a pre ##tens ##e of repay ##ing the money , ' ' said mr . green .
eventually , mr . green testified , he began duck ##ing out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited .
appalled , mr . green never paid the money , he testified .
but he did n ' t complain to the state ' s judicial inquiry and review board , either , saying later that he feared retribution .
mr . o ' kick ##i said he will respond to mr . green ' s all ##ega ##tion at his trial .
like most of cam ##bria county ' s lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge , mr . green declined to be interviewed for this article .
and no one with a complaint about the judge would allow his name to be printed .
says another lawyer : ` ` the practice of law is a matter of biting one ' s lip when you live in a small community .
one had best not dance on top of a coffin until the lid is sealed tightly shut . ' '
the judge was considered imp ##eri ##ous , ab ##ras ##ive and ambitious , those who practiced before him say .
the judge , they say , was fiercely proud of his abilities and accomplishments .
the dealers ##hip du ##ti ##fully recorded the sale under the name ` ` judge o ' kick ##i . ' '
` ` until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . ' '
state investigators dispute that view now , particularly in light of the judge ' s various business dealings in cam ##bria county .
the judge came under scrutiny in late 1987 , after the state attorney general ' s office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in cam ##bria county .
even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according to the grand jury report .
but when the judge received his payment book , he di ##sa ##vo ##wed the deal .
after laurel bank tried to rep ##oss ##ess the car , a vice president asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account .
the incident was n ' t the only time the judge got special treatment from his local bank .
paul l . kane , laurel ' s president at the time , quickly responded .
his seven - bedroom cedar and brick house outside of johns ##town is up for sale to pay for his lawyers .
the judge says he is confident he will return to his old bench .
already , he notes , the 76 charges originally filed against him have been trimmed to 27 .
most of the allegations no longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn by state prosecutors as part of a pre - trial agreement .
the heart of the case - - ` ` official oppression ' ' - - remains intact .
` ` if i lose , i lose my position , my career , my pension , my home and my investments , ' ' says the judge .
` ` my god and i know i am correct and innocent .

japan has found another safe outlet for its money : u . s . home mortgage ##s .
` ` interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago . ' '
the steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the u . s . has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here .
evidence of the growing japanese demand for mortgage securities ab ##ound ##s .
` ` this year , some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot . ' '
ultimately , he says , strong demand could help to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities .
at the moment , no ##mura is the only japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of fan ##nie mae instruments .
but other japanese institutions say privately that they are considering asking to join the 59 - dealer selling group .
these securities are attractive to japanese investors for three reasons .
at the moment , some offer as much as 1 . 6 to 1 . 8 percentage points over treasury securities of similar mat ##urities .
but there is a risk , which the japanese discovered when they first dipped their toes into the market nearly five years ago .
` ` so they were surprised and very disappointed by prep ##ay ##ment . ' '
compound ##ing the trouble to japanese investors , mortgage securities pay interest monthly , since most mortgage ##s require home ##own ##ers to make monthly payments .
but japanese institutional investors are used to quarterly or semi ##ann ##ual payments on their investments , so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems .
as a result , japanese investors steered clear of the mortgage securities .
but they did n ' t lose touch with the u . s . issue ##rs .
therefore , the debate about poison pills will continue to rage in the board ##rooms of corporations and the halls of academia .
however , these discount purchase rights may generally be red ##eem ##ed at a nominal cost by the corporation ' s directors if they approve of a bid ##der .
does this corporation have a high - quality management team with a good track record ?
does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values , and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period ?
will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy ?
if the answers to these questions are affirmative , then institutional investors are likely to be favorably disposed toward a specific poison pill .
however , the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted , they survive forever .
although the current management team may be outstanding , who will be the ceo in 10 years ?
although the five - year strategy may be excellent , what will be the strategy in 25 years ?
the solution to this problem is a time - limited poison pill .
the limit could range from three years to seven years , depending on the composition of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan .
another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by pittsburgh - based national inter ##group inc . , a diversified holding company .
this pill automatically ex ##pire ##s after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders .
more widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team ' s strategy .
such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more fruit ##ful dialogue between management and shareholders than the abstract debate about poison pills .
mr . po ##zen is the general counsel and a managing director of fidelity investments in boston .
michael blair , former president and chief executive officer of enfield corp . , failed to win election to the company ' s board at a special shareholder meeting .
holders at the meeting elected a full slate of canadian express nominees to enfield ' s 11 - member board .
mr . blair and hee ##s have been feud ##ing for months .
the ontario supreme court overturned mr . blair ' s decision .
he said his suit against enfield seeks two years se ##verance pay , equivalent to c $ 720 , 000 .
hee ##s and canadian express executives could n ' t be reached for comment .
enfield is a holding company with interests in manufacturing concerns .
it is 38 . 5 % owned by canadian express , another holding company .
hee ##s is a merchant bank controlled by toronto fin ##an ##cier ##s peter and edward bro ##n ##fm ##an .
but in another sense , the $ 84 ##6 million purchase is un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##istic ##ally ne ##r ##vy , industry analysts say .
` ` on balance , we think it will be positive . ' '
but some japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being .
in particular , they critic ##ize the timing , coming as it does on the heels of sony corp . ' s controversial purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc .
` ` officially , yes , we encourage the free flow of direct investment , ' ' says a foreign ministry official .
` ` but they did n ' t have to choose this particular moment . ' '
during the past year , government officials and leading business organizations have repeatedly urged japanese companies to refrain from flash ##y real estate purchases in the
many japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country ' s leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties .
critics say mitsubishi estate ' s decision to buy into rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of japan .
but to mitsubishi estate , the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides .
first of all , it is a friendly acquisition in which rockefeller sought out mitsubishi estate and asked it to buy a majority share .
finally , mitsubishi estate has no plans to interfere with rockefeller ' s management beyond taking a place on the board .
rockefeller may well have found its match in mitsubishi estate , a company of long history , strong government ties and sound resources .
in asset terms , mitsubishi estate is the largest real estate firm in japan .
at the time , japan had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a western - style business center .
mitsubishi built the government ' s dream development , the story goes , in exchange for the official decision to locate tokyo ' s central railway station there .
mitsubishi estate is one of the dozens of companies in today ' s mitsubishi group .
nonetheless , it will barely make a dent in mitsubishi estate ' s finances , analysts say .
analysts say the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrant ##s .
meanwhile , at home , mitsubishi has control of some major projects .
the center ##piece of that complex , the landmark tower , will be japan ' s tallest building when it is completed in 1993 .
in separate statements , the two sides said they want to have ` ` further discussions . ' '
sony is acquiring columbia and gu ##ber - peters entertainment co . in two separate transactions valued at more than $ 5 billion .
both warner and sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions .
but the people familiar with the talks said that warner is n ' t expected to get any cash in the settlement .
instead , sony is likely to agree to let warner participate in certain of its businesses , such as the record club of sony ' s cbs records unit .
warner has surpassed sony as the largest record company , but it does n ' t have a powerful world - wide record club like cbs .
the two sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to columbia ' s movies .
but both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other ' s terms to resolve the issue .
any settlement is also expected to exclude mr . gu ##ber and mr . peters from any of the projects they were working on at warner .
once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development , producers are typically free to take it elsewhere .
the two producers own a combined 28 % stake in gu ##ber - peters .
` ` the terms announced today are strictly between the united states and gulf power , ' ' said u . s . attorney robert l . barr .
` ` this is only a further step in a lengthy investigation . ' '
gulf power had been under investigation for violating the utility holding company act , which prohibits public utilities from making political contributions .
and our action today will allow gulf power to avoid prolonged , distracting legal proceedings . ' '
he did not say what effect , if any , the $ 500 , 000 fine would have on the company ' s earnings .
the apple ##yard agency , for example , allegedly made contributions from 1982 to 1984 to various funds for political candidates , then submitted bills to gulf power .
government officials declined to say whether the investigation includes the ad agencies or the politicians involved .

but at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse , some liquor market ##ers consider sea ##gram ' s frequent buyer promotion risky .

others question the impact on chi ##vas ' s upscale image of a promotion that has customers soaking off labels .
` ` it ' s really bizarre , ' ' says albert le ##rman , creative director at the wells rich greene ad agency .
` ` chi ##vas has an image of something you would sa ##vor , rather than gu ##zzle . ' '
chi ##vas class is n ' t the first such promotion .
last year , j & b scotch offered 500 t ##wa frequent fl ##ier miles in exchange for a label .
and dew ##ar ' s gave discount ##s on scottish merchandise to people who sent in bottle labels .
but the scope of sea ##gram ' s chi ##vas promotion sets it apart .
the current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive three - to - five - year direct marketing plan .
sea ##gram says the promotion is designed to build brand loyalty rather than promote heavy drinking .
` ` we ' re not asking them to save up 50 proof - of - purchases .
we ' re not saying drink more , we ' re saying trade up . ' '
go ##ya con ##co ##cts a milk for hispanic tastes
most food companies these days are trim ##ming the fat and cho ##les ##terol content of their products to appeal to health - conscious consumers .
but go ##ya foods inc . believes it can milk some sales by buck ##ing the trend .
that compares with 3 . 5 % butter ##fat for whole milk .
a spokesman for bo ##rden inc . , the nation ' s largest milk producer , con ##cede ##s go ##ya may be on to something .
bo ##rden sells considerably more whole milk than reduced - fat milk ##s in southern and hispanic markets , he says .
bo ##rden even tested a milk with 4 % butter ##fat in the south , but decided the market was too small .
go ##ya is selling le ##che fr ##es ##ca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bo ##de ##gas in new york and parts of new jersey .
and it ' s adding 15 to 20 new outlets a day , says greg ric ##ca , sales director at la le ##cher ##ia .
because of le ##che fr ##es ##ca ' s success , he says , the joint venture is developing other dairy products tailored to hispanic tastes .
for years , costume jewelry makers fought a losing battle .
jewelry displays in department stores were often cl ##uttered and un ##ins ##pired .
as a result , market ##ers of faux gems steadily lost space in department stores to more fashionable rivals - - cosmetics makers .
but lately , retailers say , fake has become more fashionable .
and jewelry makers are beginning to use many of the same marketing tricks hon ##ed in the aggressive world of cosmetics .
last year , the total women ' s fashion jewelry business topped $ 4 . 9 billion , says karen al ##berg , editor of accessories magazine .
and it ' s growing fast , with annual sales gains of more than 10 % .

but cosmetics firms still have one big marketing edge : they mo ##tiv ##ate sales people with commissions .

that the membership number has even kept close to its 1976 size is the result of the ` ` gray ##ing ' ' of the church .

for years , a strict regime ##n governed the staff meetings at nissan motor co . ' s technical center in tokyo ' s western suburbs .
employees wore identification badges listing not only their names but also their dates of hire .
in recent years , nissan has instituted flex - time work schedules and allowed employees to dress casually , even in blue jeans .
a rule forbid ##ding staff ##ers to own competitors ' cars has been lifted , and now many designers drive foreign cars to get useful ideas .
and in a japanese corporate first , nissan recently opened the first coe ##d company dormitory for single employees at the suburban tokyo technical center .
` ` but in the end , top management decided to follow the voice of the younger generation . ' '
the company ' s turn ##around is far from complete ; many crucial tests are just beginning .
but its surprising progress so far holds important lessons for companies in trouble .
` ` this is a time of self - criticism to discover what is wrong with us , ' ' he said .
yu ##taka ku ##me , who took the helm as nissan ' s president in june 1985 , added simply , ` ` i am deeply disappointed . ' '
nissan ' s market share in japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade .
its u . s . sales sagged , partly because of price increases due to the rising yen .
worst of all , nissan was preoccupied with management in ##fighting , cr ##ony ##ism and corporate rigid ##ity .
consider the experience of sato ##ko kit ##ada , a 30 - year - old designer of vehicle interiors who joined nissan in 1982 .
at that time , tasks were assigned strictly on the basis of senior ##ity .
` ` the oldest designer got to work on the dashboard , ' ' she recalls .
if a new person got to work on part of the speed ##ometer , that was a big deal . ' '
this system produced boring , box ##y cars that consumers just were n ' t buying .
desperately hoping to spark sales , nissan transferred 5 , 000 middle managers and plant workers to dealers ##hips .
some town - watching excursion ##s were down ##right comic .
but when they arrived at the door , all were afraid to go in , fearing that they would be out of place .
mr . ku ##me himself visited honda ' s headquarters in tokyo ' s upscale ao ##yama district .
he liked the well - lighted lobby display of honda ' s cars and trucks so much that he had nissan ' s gloom ##y lobby exhibit refurbished .
later , nissan borrowed other honda practices , including an engineering ` ` idea contest ' ' to promote in ##vent ##ive ##ness .
one engineer developed a ` ` crab car ' ' that moves sideways .
despite the pain of adjusting , the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars .
since then , nissan also has launched new versions of the $ 13 , 249 240 ##s ##x sport ##y coupe and 300 ##z ##x sports car .
besides new styling , the new nissan ##s have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems .
all three new models are outs ##elling their predecessors by wide margins .
in its home market , nissan has grabbed attention with limited - production mini ##cars featuring styling odd enough to be cute .
one is the pa ##o , a tiny coupe with a peel ##back canvas top and tilted headlights that give it a dr ##oop ##y - eyed look .
then , there ' s the s - cargo , an off ##beat delivery van with a snail - like body that inspired its name .
nissan helped develop a tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme .
the chairs are s - cargo seats , and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the pa ##o ' s oversized speed ##ometer .
all these vehicles have sharply improved nissan ' s morale and image - - but have n ' t done much for its market share .
nissan had 29 % of the japanese car market in 1980 before beginning a de ##pressing eight - year slide that continued through last year .
so far , nissan ' s new - model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential .
in compact and sub ##com ##pac ##t cars , the bread - and - butter sales generators for japanese auto makers , nissan still trails toyota and honda .
nissan hopes that that will start to change this fall , with its new version of the stanza compact sedan .
the stanza has been a none ##nti ##ty compared with honda ' s hugely successful accord and toyota ' s cam ##ry .
but this year , honda has rev ##amp ##ed the accord and made it a mid ##si ##zed car .
nissan will introduce a completely rev ##amp ##ed sent ##ra next fall .
nissan started advertising in ##fin ##iti fully eight months before the cars hit american show ##rooms .
the ads featured fences , rocks and pussy - willow buds - - almost anything but the cars themselves .
the ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other u . s . auto advertising .
on the other hand , nissan ' s sales goals for in ##fin ##iti are modest compared with toyota ' s targets for lex ##us .
toyota wants to sell about 49 , 000 lex ##us l ##s ##400 sedan ##s next year in the u . s . alone .
these days nissan can afford that strategy , even though profits are n ' t exactly robust .
nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in japanese car sales .
but nissan expects to earn only 120 billion yen in the current fiscal year , a modest increase of 4 . 7 % .
the big reason : for all its cost - cutting , nissan remains less efficient than toyota .
in its last fiscal year , nissan ' s profit represented just 2 . 3 % of sales , compared with 4 . 3 % at toyota .
to help close the gap , nissan recently established a top - level cost - cutting committee .
that gives it an en ##via ##ble strategic advantage , at least until its rivals catch up , but also plenty of managerial headache ##s .
and in july , nissan ' s tennessee manufacturing plant beat back a united auto workers organizing effort with aggressive tactics that have left some workers bitter .
he promises that nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all u . s . operations , just as it ' s doing in europe .
perhaps the biggest challenge , however , will be to prevent a return to its former corporate rigid ##ity as its recovery continues .
already , personnel officials are talking about the need for a ` ` phase two ' ' cultural - reform effort of some sort .
he adds , however , that ` ` the momentum we have generated is un ##sto ##ppa ##ble .

the white house is purposely not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo n ' t be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements .
despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations , the meeting could pay significant political divide ##nds for both leaders .
mr . go ##rba ##chev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home .
a face - to - face meeting with mr . go ##rba ##chev should damp such criticism , though it will hardly eliminate it .
but he added : ` ` the mere fact of a meeting does n ' t deal with the substance of policy . ' '
the president specifically mentioned u . s . economic advice to moscow as a possible topic .
mr . go ##rba ##chev has for months been publicly urging the u . s . to drop its restrictions on soviet trade .
the soviets hope a trade agreement would give them most - favored nation status , which would lower the tariffs on soviet exports to the u . s . .
economists in moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits .
but one bush administration official knowledge ##able about the summit plan caution ##ed against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the soviet economy or other issues .
` ` those things will all come up , but in a fairly informal way . ' '
instead , this official said , ` ` this is vintage george bush .
it ' s george bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly . ' '
that theme has been a recurring one for soviet military officials for much of this year .
that meeting sent shivers through the western alliance because mr . reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting american allies .
indeed , many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that mr . bush was n ' t interested in such an informal get - together .

hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging limp protesters from some building or thorough ##fare in one of our cities .
the maha ##tma , or ` ` great soul ##ed one , ' ' ins ##ti ##gated several campaigns of passive resistance against the british government in india .
the case of rosa parks , the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus , comes to mind as an illustration .
but most cases of non - violent civil di ##so ##bed ##ience are not nearly so benign .
the public has a tendency to e ##qua ##te lawful demonstrations with non - violent civil di ##so ##bed ##ience .
it is true that both are non - violent , but there is a fundamental difference between them .
civil di ##so ##bed ##ience , violent or non - violent , is intentional law breaking .
they are useful to call public attention to gr ##ie ##vances , but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute .
civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abe ##tted by superficial media interviews .
at best , demonstrations are over ##used and boring ##ly un ##in ##form ##ative ; at worst , they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking .
demonstrations are particularly apt to de ##gen ##erate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the gr ##ie ##vance and become mobile .
soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania .
some find no harm in the mis ##de ##me ##anor ##s of tres ##pass , minor property destruction , blocking traffic and the like .
they say these are small prices to pay for gal ##vani ##zing action for the all - important cause .
the crimes may appear small , but the prices can be huge .
assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car .
the protesters lie down in the street , blocking traffic , and will not move until the authorities carry them away .
assume that someone caught in the jam has a heart attack .
there is no way to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital .
the demonstration was non - violent and involved only a simple mis ##de ##me ##anor , but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal .
assume that a tv network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience .
the politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of ran ##cor amid certain groups .
the network must ref ##und money to the ad ##vert ##iser ##s and loses considerable revenue and prestige .
gerald ##o or phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters .
it is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in vietnam and cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine - tuned .
give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law , and no second invitation will be required .
this brings into question the motives of those who lead civil di ##so ##bed ##ience demonstrations .
do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ?
in either case , ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil di ##so ##bed ##ience .
if you have not , it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course .

penalty overhaul is still likely , congressional sources say .
long - debated proposals to sim ##plify the more than 150 civil penalties and make them fair ##er and easier to administer are in the house tax bill .
but they were stripped from the senate bill after staff ##ers estimated penalty revenue would fall by $ 216 million over five years .
still , congressional aide ##s say penalty reform is a strong candidate for enactment , even if not this time around , although some provisions may be modified .
he would ease the proposed penalties for delayed payroll - tax deposits and for faulty form 109 ##9 and other reports that taxpayers correct voluntarily .
the general accounting office urges congress to ensure that all penalties retain their force as deter ##rent ##s .
taxpayers ' rights are defined by a growing number of states .
the 1988 tax act created a federal bill of rights spelling out irs duties to protect taxpayers ' rights in the assessment and collection of taxes .
and taxpayer groups are urging legislation in many other states .
one group is the committee on state taxation , which comprises 330 multi ##sta ##te corporations and advises the council of state chambers of commerce .
the group also seeks uniform ##ity among states in provisions for taxpayers ' rights .
this week , new york city announced a 10 - point policy patterned on the federal bill of rights for taxpayers .

eastern , a unit of texas air corp . , said it is examining the ruling to determine if it can appeal .
all eastern ' s previous court efforts to head off the pilots ' demands have failed .
bankruptcy experts said the law is n ' t clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company ' s case .
like any other credit ##or , the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim .
in august , he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their back - pay gr ##ie ##vance before the ar ##bit ##rator .
the pilots ' contract with eastern calls for a mutually acceptable private ar ##bit ##rator to resolve such gr ##ie ##vances .
in a statement to employees , eastern said the company was disappointed by the ruling .
` ` the obligation is totally un ##war ##rant ##ed , ' ' the statement said .
james lin ##sey , a lawyer for the air line pilots association , said the pilots were extremely pleased .
` ` this is a blow not only to eastern but to the creditors committee , ' ' he said .
eastern and its creditors are in the final , delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline ' s debts .
an earlier plan , which had received the creditors ' approval in july , fell apart when eastern changed its business plan .
it is n ' t known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan .
the dispute between eastern and its pilots is over a ` ` pay par ##ity ' ' clause in the pilots ' contract .
the clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise .
shortly after texas air took control of eastern , some mach ##ini ##sts union supervisors received a 20 % pay raise .
the pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them .
eastern has disputed the claim , but a federal district court , an appeals court and now the ar ##bit ##rator have all sided with the pilots .
the two sides do n ' t even agree about how much money is at issue .
the pilots put the amount as high as $ 100 million , the company at $ 65 million .
a decision on that case is n ' t expected before mid - november .
ironically , many of the pilots involved have left eastern or are still striking the carrier , which filed for bankruptcy protection march 9 .
about 800 have crossed the picket lines and returned to work .
few people in the advertising business have raised as many hack ##les as alvin a . ache ##nb ##au ##m .
now , after beating them , mr . ache ##nb ##au ##m is joining them .
he joins nov . 13 , di ##sso ##lving his consulting firm , can ##ter , ache ##nb ##au ##m associates .
in years past , the ad industry ' s most distinguished executives did n ' t hesitate to ex ##cor ##cia ##te mr . ache ##nb ##au ##m .
his client contacts , meanwhile , could prove a gold mine for an agency that has had few new business wins of late .
as a consultant , he has given seminars at agencies including og ##il ##vy & math ##er on how to win new business .
at back ##er sp ##iel ##vo ##gel , mr . sp ##iel ##vo ##gel ' s hallmark has been personal involvement with all major clients .
he pam ##pers them ; he invites them to fabulous parties ; he strokes them .
mr . ache ##nb ##au ##m , too , del ##ves into his clients ' business .
` ` carl has a much higher degree of intimacy with his clients than is ordinary for an agency his size .
mr . ache ##nb ##au ##m ' s move follows the announcement last month that his consulting partner , stanley can ##ter , 66 , would retire .
mr . ache ##nb ##au ##m , who had been considering par ##ing down his firm or merging it with another small consulting outfit , soon agreed .
the two men are longtime friends and tennis partners , having met about 25 years ago .
before becoming a consultant in 1974 , mr . ache ##nb ##au ##m was a senior executive at j . walter thompson co .
he spent most of his career formula ##ting marketing strategies , but became best - known for chip ##ping away at ad agency compensation .
ad agencies typically earned a straight 15 % commission ; if a client spent $ 100 million on tv time , the agency made $ 15 million .
but mr . ache ##nb ##au ##m pioneered negotiated fees , which often worked out to less than 15 % .
he ultimately became so well - known for cutting compensation , however , that clients did n ' t seek him out for anything else .
` ` i was very frustrated , ' ' he said .
` ` the fact of the matter is , i am a market ##er .
that ' s another reason - lc ##b - for the back ##er sp ##iel ##vo ##gel job - rc ##b - .
it struck me as a way to get back to what i really want to do . ' '
mr . sp ##iel ##vo ##gel added pointedly : ` ` the pressure on commissions did n ' t begin with al ache ##nb ##au ##m . ' '
he will concentrate on , among others , j . p . morgan and hyundai .
` ` the trail of revenue is increasingly going away from pure advertising , and going towards other services , ' ' mr . sp ##iel ##vo ##gel said .
instead of being just an ad agency , he said : ` ` we have red ##efined our mission here .
our mission is to help our clients grow , and to use every tool of marketing communications to accomplish that . ' '
industry executives are wishing mr . ache ##nb ##au ##m well .
and much better at that than at - lc ##b - the price - cutting - rc ##b - he ' s been doing recently . ' '

mikhail go ##rba ##chev , he said , is ahead of china ' s leaders in his awareness of the world .
` ` but i think the soviet peoples are more intro ##verted than the chinese . ' '
in such an arrangement , ` ` all benefit , ' ' he said .

we are willing to share the political burden of being host to america , an imperial power .
we think it is n ' t such a great burden , that it carries no stigma , and we are prepared to do it . ' '

` ` all we could do was tell a patient , ` squeeze my fingers as hard as you can ' or ` raise your arm . '
` ` under the best circumstances such tests are subjective ; when a patient is unconscious , they do n ' t work at all .
magnetic brain t ##we ##aking started in the early 1900s , when researchers produced flashes of light in the visual field with magnet ##s .
in the 1960s , mayo clinic researchers developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other limbs .
the field took off in 1985 after scientists at britain ' s sheffield university developed a handy , compact magnet for brain stimulation .
since then , at least two commercial versions have been put on the u . s . market , and an estimated 500 have been sold .
in august , a chicago conference on such devices attracted more than 100 researchers , who reported studies on everything from brain mapping to physical therapy .
a problem , he adds , is that an ##est ##het ##ized brains are more resistant to magnetic stimulation than awake ones .
the devices could help indicate when surgery would help , says charles ta ##tor , a university of toronto ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##on .
for example , paralyzed car - crash victims occasionally have some intact spinal tissues that , if preserved by emergency surgery , enable partial recovery .
but such operations typically are n ' t performed because there is no sign right after an injury that surgery would be beneficial .
scientists caution there is a chance the magnet technique might spark seizures in ep ##ile ##ptic ##s .
but no significant problems have been reported among hundreds of people tested with the devices .
one apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain hormone .
and some doctors who have conducted hours of tests on themselves report temporary headache ##s .
researchers can apply for permission to use the probe ##s for brain studies .
similarly , a purdue university team led by heart researcher w . a . tack ##er hopes to develop ways to magnetic ##ally induce cardiac muscle contraction ##s .
the devices ' most remarkable possibilities , though , involve the brain .
similar studies are expected to reveal how stroke patients ' brains reg ##roup - - a first step toward finding ways to bo ##lster that process and speed rehabilitation .
scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines .
at the state university of new york at brooklyn , researchers flash two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs .
between flashes , certain areas in subjects ' brains are jolted with a magnetic st ##im ##ulator .
when the jolt is timed just right , the subjects do n ' t recall seeing the first group of letters .
` ` where does that first stimulus go ? ' ' ex ##claim ##s sun ##y ne ##uro ##logist paul mac ##ca ##bee .
` ` trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories , ' ' such as precisely where and how the brain processes incoming signals from the eyes .
he and others say that the machines are weak enough that they do n ' t je ##opa ##rdi ##ze the memory .
both the sun ##y team and researchers at the national magnet laboratory in cambridge , mass . , are working with more potent magnetic brain st ##im ##ulator ##s .
among other things , the stronger devices may be able to summon forth half - forgotten memories and induce mood changes , ne ##uro ##logists say .
the materials , discovered during the past three years , conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller , faster computers and other new technologies .
the latest research pact bo ##lster ##s du pont ' s growing portfolio of investments in super ##con ##du ##ctors .

j . c . penn ##ey co . , dallas , said it issued $ 350 million of securities backed by credit - card rec ##ei ##vable ##s .
the offering was priced with an 8 . 95 % coup ##on rate at 99 . 1875 % to yield 9 . 19 % .
they pay interest only for 115 months , with principal payments beginning thereafter .

here in this new center for japanese assembly plants just across the border from san diego , turnover is dizzy ##ing , infrastructure sho ##ddy , bureaucracy intense .
mexico , with its desperate need for investment , and japan , with its huge budget surplus , would seem like a perfect match .
but the two countries remain separated by a cultural barrier wider than the ocean .
conservative japanese investors are put off by what they consider mexico ' s restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits .
japan ranks as only the fourth largest foreign investor in mexico , with 5 % of the total investments .
that is just 1 % of all the money japan has invested abroad .
mexican president carlos sal ##inas de go ##rta ##ri would like to change that .
the young president so admire ##s japanese discipline that he sends his children to a japanese school in mexico city .
he already has fin ##ag ##led a $ 2 billion loan from the japanese government .
mr . sal ##inas ' s unpopular institutional revolutionary party , or pri , faces congressional elections in 1991 .
but maintaining the key components of his strategy - - a stable exchange rate and high level of imports - - will consume enormous amounts of foreign exchange .
mr . sal ##inas needs big investment in ##flow ##s - - quickly .
the problem is that japanese businesses make decisions with a view well beyond the coming months that weigh so heavily on mr . sal ##inas .
` ` when the fruit is ripe , it falls from the tree by itself , ' ' he says .
pressed on the matter , he is more specific .
` ` there will be big japanese investments probably five to 10 years from now . ' '
ryu ##kic ##hi im ##ai , japan ' s ambassador to mexico , agrees that mexico may be too eager .
i do n ' t think that is the case . ' '
mexican officials maintain the japanese reserve is only a result of unfamiliar ##ity .
` ` because of distance , it takes a while for them to appreciate the economic stability we ' ve achieved , ' ' says one economic policy ##maker .
mexico is sending a number of missions to japan looking for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications , pet ##ro ##chemical ##s or tourism .
it is hoped that other japanese would then follow the leader .
unable to get a new law through a congress with a strong leftist bloc , mexico jury - rigged the existing law ' s regulations .
it created special 20 - year trusts to allow foreigners 100 % ownership in some once - closed industries .
it also made art ##ful use of semantics , red ##ef ##ining as non - strategic industries some that had been in the national domain .

opinion is mixed over its three - month prospects .
half of those polled see the currency trend ##ing lower over the next three months , while the others forecast a modest rebound after the new year .
a month ago , a similar survey predicted the dollar would be trading at 1 . 86 ##90 marks and 139 . 75 yen by the end of october .
sterling was trading at $ 1 . 580 ##5 , down from $ 1 . 58 ##20 late monday .
the average of estimates of the 10 economists polled puts the dollar around 1 . 820 ##0 marks at the end of november and at 141 . 33 yen .
by late january , the consensus calls for the dollar to be trading around 1 . 820 ##0 marks and near 142 yen .
a number of those polled predict the dollar will slip as the federal reserve ease ##s interest rates .
fed funds is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans ; the fed influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system .
mr . white also predicted a half - point cut in the u . s . discount rate in the near future .
the discount rate , currently 7 % , is the rate the fed charges member banks for loans , using government securities as collateral .
he expects such a cut ` ` because of problems in several sectors of the economy , particularly real estate and automobiles . ' '
the drop marked the largest monthly tumble since a 19 % slide in january 1982 .
indeed , in early october the west german central bank raised its discount and lombard rates by a full percentage point .
several other european central banks , notably in britain , followed the west german bun ##des ##bank ' s lead by raising their own key rates .
and a week later , japan raised its official discount rate by a half point to 3 . 75 % .
the japanese discount rate is the central bank ' s base rate on loans to commercial banks .
g - 7 consists of the u . s . , japan , britain , west germany , canada , france and italy .
mr . ka ##kit ##a said the key dollar - yen exchange rate is at 135 yen .
he contend ##ed that the fed wo n ' t ease rates further , but predicted bun ##des ##bank officials will relax key rates in west germany .
alfred za ##pf ##el , chief trader at bank of boston in frankfurt , took an opposite stance .
west german interest rates , he said , will remain unchanged .
` ` but i ' m not one of these great dollar bears you see more of these days , ' ' mr . za ##pf ##el said .
` ` i ca n ' t really see it dropping far below 1 . 80 marks . ' '
but , he warned , the currency will remain at risk .
on the commodity exchange in new york , gold for current delivery dropped $ 3 . 10 to $ 37 ##4 . 70 an ounce in moderate trading .
estimated volume was 3 . 5 million ounce ##s .
in early trading in hong kong wednesday , gold was quoted at $ 37 ##3 . 80 an ounce .
west germany will repeal the unpopular turnover tax on securities transactions as of jan . 1 , 1991 , economics minister helmut ha ##uss ##mann said .
he said the government will also repeal the 1 % transaction tax on the first - time purchase of stakes in companies .
in the interview , mr . ha ##uss ##mann did n ' t specify the amount of revenue the government will lose after the tax disappears .
now , the white house has decided to accept the higher wage over only two years .
the sub - minimum wage would apply only to first - time teen - age workers for 90 days .
the white house had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation .
chemical said steven ed ##els ##on resigned recently , but one individual close to the situation said the resignation was forced .
mr . ed ##els ##on could n ' t be reached for comment .
a separate inquiry by chemical cleared mr . ed ##els ##on of allegations that he had been lavish ##ly entertained by a new york money broker .
that inquiry has n ' t resolved similar allegations involving another chemical options trader .
in other personnel changes stemming from problems in its options unit :
mr . wake ##man , whom chemical tried to keep , did n ' t return calls for comment .
a chemical spoke ##sw ##oman said the second - quarter charge was ` ` not material ' ' and that no personnel changes were made as a result .
the spoke ##sw ##oman said the frankfurt situation was ` ` totally different ' ' from problems in the interest - rate options unit .
these complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions .
in a forward - rate agreement , a client agrees to an exchange rate on a future currency transaction .
started three years ago , chemical ' s interest - rate options group was a leading force in the field .
from 1987 to 1988 , the value of chemical ' s option contracts outstanding mushroom ##ed to $ 37 billion from $ 17 billion .
more importantly , the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost 2 - to - 1 .
with such a lo ##ps ##ided book of options , traders say , chemical was more vulnerable to er ##rone ##ous valuation assumptions .
the chemical spoke ##sw ##oman said the bank has examined its method ##ologies and internal controls .
` ` we consider our internal controls to have worked well , ' ' she said , adding that some procedures have been strengthened .
its valuation method ##ologies , she said , ` ` are recognized as some of the best on the street .
then there were two gold watches once owned by allan pink ##erton , who founded the company in chicago in 1850 .
but there were supposed to be three , mr . wat ##hen ' s company claims .
` ` we cleared out a lot of rats ' nests , ' ' says the 60 - year - old security veteran .
he joined the firm in 1963 and bought it from the owners the next year .
over the next 20 years , california plant protection opened 125 offices around the country .
` ` the security business is my favorite subject .
i love this business , ' ' he says .
` ` most of the lb ##o guys do n ' t know how to run a business anyway . ' '
` ` we were n ' t allowed to do any due dil ##igen ##ce because of competitive reasons .
if we had , it might have scared us off , ' ' he says .
he says his team could n ' t tell whether accounts rec ##ei ##vable had been paid or not .
and regional offices were ` ` e ##gre ##gio ##usly overs ##taff ##ed , ' ' he claims .
one office had 19 people doing the work of three , ` ` and half of the employees had company automobiles . ' '
american brands declined to comment on mr . wat ##hen ' s accusations .
mr . wat ##hen says his turn ##around strategy has been simple : just hack away at the fat .
he shut down the company ' s tony new york headquarters .
pink ##erton ' s world headquarters today is a non ##des ##cript , two - story office building across the street from the small van nu ##ys airport .
and he got rid of low - margin businesses that just were n ' t making money for the company .
this year , mr . wat ##hen says the firm will be able to service debt and still turn a modest profit .
now pink ##erton ' s could become en ##tangled in a pro ##tracted legal fra ##cas with its former parent .
` ` as this is now a litigation matter , we have no further comment . ' '
and then there ' s the case of the missing gold watch .
the key to pink ##erton ' s future will be sticking to what it does best - - being a security company , says mr . wat ##hen .
the company is also renew ##ing its emphasis on investigations , particularly undercover investigations for corporations .
american brands ` ` just had a different approach , ' ' mr . wat ##hen says .
` ` their approach did n ' t work ; mine is .

paramount said the gain would be recorded in its fourth quarter , which ended yesterday .
paramount said the sale ` ` completes the strategic restructuring ' ' it began in 1983 , and would enable it to focus on its entertainment and publishing businesses .
ford said in july it planned to operate associates , based in dallas , as a separate entity in its ford financial services group .
together with the 3 . 6 million shares currently controlled by management , subsidiaries and directors , the completed tender offer would give sea containers a controlling stake .
of the proceeds , $ 500 million will be used to fund its tender offer .
sea containers added that the rec ##ap ##ital ##ization plan will reduce its debt by more than $ 500 million .
news of the restructuring plan sent sea containers ' shares up $ 1 to $ 62 in new york stock exchange composite trading .
the company said its directors , management and subsidiaries will remain long - term investors and wo n ' t tender any of their shares under the offer .
sea containers said the offer will proceed after the bermuda supreme court lifts or mod ##ifies an interim injunction restraining the company from buying its shares .
that injunction resulted from litigation between temple and sea containers last may .
the company said the court has indicated it will make a decision on or about nov . 27 .
sea containers will soon set a date for its annual shareholder meeting to seek holder approval for the offer .
you ' d think all the stories about well - heel ##ed communities and developers getting hu ##d grants would prompt congress to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies .
congress has just made it easier for the affluent to qualify for ins ##ured loans from the deficit - ridden federal housing administration .
right now , the largest loan the f ##ha can ins ##ure in high - cost housing markets is $ 101 , 250 .
but it does that at the cost of deep ##ening the taxpayer ' s exposure if the f ##ha is forced to pay for more loans going sour .
this is no idle fear last year the f ##ha lost $ 4 . 2 billion in loan default ##s .
but the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what senator alan cr ##ans ##ton and majority leader george mitchell have in mind for housing .
the senate banking committee will begin hearings next week on their proposal to expand existing federal housing programs .
other senators want to lower the down payments required on f ##ha - ins ##ured loans .
that would be a formula for ensuring even more f ##ha red ink .
experience has shown that the most important element in predicting a housing - loan default is the down payment .
if housing prices continue to fall , many borrow ##ers would be better off walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses .
much the same thing happened with busted s & l ##s , a problem congress just ` ` solved ' ' with a $ 166 billion bail ##out .
we hear that hu ##d secretary jack kemp is toy ##ing with going along with some of the cr ##ans ##ton - mitchell proposals .
that sounds like a formula for ensuring that he gets dragged into the next hu ##d tar pit .
but even if he agrees , mr . kemp does n ' t write the nation ' s housing law - - congress does .
and the majority of members cynical ##ly view the current disc ##red ##iting of hu ##d as mainly a chance to shove through their own slate of projects .
none of the grants had been requested by hu ##d , judged competitive ##ly or were the subject of a single hearing .
more and more observers now realize that the key to ending future hu ##d scandals lies in forcing congress to clean up its own act .
the sun concluded that mr . pierce is only part of the problem - - and a part that ' s gone .
of course , self - reform is about the last thing this congress is interested in .
proponents of expanding f ##ha programs say they merely want to help home buyers who are frozen out of high - priced markets .
but the f ##ha program is hem ##or ##rh ##aging bad loans .
jack kemp has submitted a package of reforms , and they are surely headed for the capitol hill sausage - grind ##er .
like the s & l mess before it , this is a problem congress should be solving , not ignoring .
gill ##ette co . , boston , said it is planning to rest ##ru ##cture its south african subsidiary .
a final agreement has not been signed , and the moves will not have a material effect on the company , gill ##ette said .
the company said it is part of a continuing world - wide restructuring in which it has downs ##ized or sold operations in several countries .
about 60 % of the work force will continue with gill ##ette or transfer to twins pharmaceuticals , the company said .

the new orleans oil and gas exploration and diving operations company added that it does n ' t expect any further adverse financial impact from the restructuring .
the latest period had profit from continuing operations of $ 4 million .

ocean drilling said it will offer 15 % to 20 % of the contract - drilling business through an initial public offering in the near future .
it has long been rumored that ocean drilling would sell the unit to concentrate on its core oil and gas business .
ocean drilling said it wo n ' t hold any shares of the new company after the restructuring .
corporate leaders , frustrated by double - digit increases in health - care costs , are beginning to sound like liberal democrats .
the pocket ##book impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus .
but there are signs that labor - management cooperation could change the politics of health - care legislation and the economics of medicine .
because the bush administration is n ' t taking the initiative on health issues , business executives are dealing with congressional democrats who champion health - care revision .
` ` it ' s a bottom - line issue . ' '
partly in response , a bi ##partisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan to attract broader support .
it will feature a cost - containment provision designed to keep expanded benefits from fuel ##ing higher care prices .
at 11 . 1 % of gross national product , u . s . health costs already are the highest in the world .
by contrast , japan ' s equal 6 . 7 % of g ##np , a nation ' s total output of goods and services .
management and labor worry that the gap makes u . s . companies less competitive .
health benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against pitt ##ston co . and ny ##ne ##x corp .
some analysts are cynical about the new corporate interest in health - care overhaul .
` ` they hope they can buy some government cost discipline , ' ' but this is a false hope , mr . sc ##hra ##mm says .
he asserts that government has done an even worse job of controlling its health bill than business .
so far neither the bush administration nor congress is prepared to lead the way toward rev ##amp ##ing health care .
the administration lacks a comprehensive health - care policy .
advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures .
h ##hs secretary sullivan estimates that as much as 25 % of the medical procedures performed each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary .
limiting care wo n ' t be easy or popular .
this will ` ` require us to define - - and red ##ef ##ine - - what is ` necessary ' or ` appropriate ' care .
the afl - ci ##o also embrace ##s treatment guidelines .
at a meeting here on nov . 15 , the labor federation plans to launch a major effort to build grass - roots support for health - care overhaul .

` ` i ' m hopeful that we ' ll have further discussions , ' ' mr . hahn said .
georgia - pacific closed down $ 2 . 50 , at $ 50 . 875 in big board trading .
it was just the culture of the industry that kept it from happening .

added mark rogers of pr ##ude ##ntial - bach ##e securities inc . : ` ` it ' s much easier to be second . ' '
a georgia - pacific acquisition of ne ##ko ##osa would create the largest u . s . forest - products company .
ne ##ko ##osa ranked 11th with sales of $ 3 . 59 billion .
the combined company would have had 1988 sales of $ 13 . 1 billion .
` ` depending on how far down you go , it may be difficult to pay off that debt . ' '
one person familiar with georgia - pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company ' s debt of almost $ 3 billion .
georgia - pacific ' s mr . hahn said that a combined operation would allow savings in many ways .
the two companies each produce market pulp , container ##board and white paper .
that means goods could be manufactured closer to customers , saving shipping costs , he said .
moreover , production runs would be longer , cutting in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##ncies from adjusting machinery between production cycles .
and georgia - pacific could save money in selling pulp , because the company uses its own sales organization while ne ##ko ##osa employs higher - cost agents .
but he said that even under those conditions , the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger .
` ` the fit is so good , we see this as a time of opportunity , ' ' he said .
georgia - pacific owns 34 ##9 , 900 ne ##ko ##osa shares and would need federal anti ##trust clearance to buy more than $ 15 million worth .
u . s . clearance also is needed for the proposed acquisition .
ne ##ko ##osa also is being advised by goldman , sachs & co .
people familiar with ne ##ko ##osa said its board is n ' t likely to meet before the week after next to respond to the bid .

investors were quick to spot other potential takeover candidates , all of which have strong cash flows and low - cost operations .
in over - the - counter national trading , bow ##ater inc . jumped $ 1 . 50 to $ 27 . 50 .
the buyers , these analysts added , could be either foreign or other u . s . concerns .
` ` i do n ' t think anyone is now immune from takeover , ' ' said robert schneider of duff & phelps inc . , chicago .
several projects , he said , are still on the drawing board .
moreover , ` ` it ' s a lot cheaper and quicker to buy a plant than to build one . ' '
indeed , a number of analysts said that japanese paper companies are hungry to acquire additional manufacturing capacity anywhere in the world .
some predicted that ne ##ko ##osa will end up being owned by a japanese company .

the increase in wage and benefit costs in the third quarter was greater than the 1 % rise reported for the third quarter of 1988 .
` ` one would have thought this would have happened two or three years ago as the labor market tightened .
it is a considerably delayed reaction and it ' s not a severe one at all , ' ' she added .
the new data under ##sco ##red the severity of the nation ' s health - care cost problem .
the consumer price index climbed 4 . 3 % in the same period .
despite the big increases in health - care costs , wages still account for a far greater share of overall labor costs .
labor costs are climbing at a far more rapid pace in the health care industry than in other industries .
for the past five years , unions have n ' t managed to win wage increases as large as those granted to non ##uni ##on workers .
for private - sector union workers , the cost of wages and benefits rose 0 . 9 % in the third quarter .
for non ##uni ##on workers , the costs rose 1 . 4 % .
labor costs continued to rise more rapidly in service industries than in goods - producing industries , the report showed .
it also found them rising much more in the northeast than elsewhere .
the index rose 1 . 1 % in the second quarter .
for the 12 months ended in september , this index was up 5 . 1 % .
it rose 4 . 8 % for the 12 months ended in june and 4 . 7 % in the 12 months ended in september 1988 .
unlike most economic indicators , none of these figures are adjusted for seasonal variations .
des ##oto inc . said it is dismissing 200 employees as part of a restructuring aimed at producing pre ##ta ##x savings of $ 10 million annually .
under the plan , des ##oto said it will sell certain assets and businesses that do n ' t meet strategic and profit ##ability objectives .
the company said it plans to use the sale proceeds to invest in business opportunities more closely identified with the company ' s ` ` ref ##oc ##used direction .

despite all the fur ##or over program trading , program trading played a big role in yesterday ' s rally .
the rally notwithstanding , there are plenty of worries about the short - term course of stock prices .
a slowing economy and its effect on corporate earnings is the foremost concern of many traders and analysts .
unless the federal reserve ease ##s interest rates soon to stimulate the economy , profits could remain disappointing .
a report late yesterday that the chicago - area purchasing managers survey showed increased economic activity in that part of the country cut into bond - price gains .
if the national survey confirms a pickup in the manufacturing sector , it could further de ##press bond prices while bo ##lster ##ing stock prices and the dollar .

these include trying to protect its print advertising by in ##voking the first amendment , and woo ##ing blacks by portraying itself as a protector of civil rights .

many market ##ers say philip morris ' s approach will be effective , but they agree that the ads ' implied smoking message is unmistakable .

richard winger , a partner at boston consulting group , adds : ` ` it ' s very popular to dr ##ape yourself in the flag these days .

technology stocks woke up , helping the over - the - counter market rise from its recent do ##ld ##rum ##s .
the nas ##da ##q composite index surged 4 . 26 , or about 0 . 94 % , to 45 ##5 . 63 .
it was the market ' s biggest gain since rising more than 7 points on oct . 19 .
advancing ot ##c stocks out ##pace ##d decline ##rs by 1 , 120 to 80 ##6 .
but the move la ##gged a stronger rise in new york stock exchange issues .
the big board ' s composite index was up more than 1 . 4 % , and the dow jones industrial average jumped 1 . 6 % .
nas ##da ##q ' s gain was led by its biggest industrial stocks .
the nas ##da ##q 100 rose 7 . 08 to 44 ##5 . 23 .
the financial index of 100 biggest banks and insurance issues added 2 . 19 to 44 ##7 . 76 .
national market system volume improved to 94 , 425 , 000 shares from 71 . 7 million monday .
many of nas ##da ##q ' s biggest technology stocks were in the forefront of the rally .
microsoft added 2 1 \ / 8 to 81 3 \ / 4 and oracle systems rose 1 1 \ / 2 to 23 1 \ / 4 .
intel was up 1 3 \ / 8 to 33 3 \ / 4 .
but traders who watch the stocks warned the rise may be yet another ` ` one - day phenomenon . ' '
but , they caution , conservative investors would do well to sell into the strength .
the technology group includes many of the ot ##c market ' s biggest stocks , which dominate the market - weighted nas ##da ##q composite index .
analysts say rallies in the group historically have lifted the market , while weakness in the sector often sank un ##list ##ed share prices broadly .
but increasing vol ##ati ##lity in the sector has exhausted investors who try to follow its dip ##s and swings .
the stocks have been pu ##mmel ##ed repeatedly by inventory g ##lu ##ts and disappointing earnings as the industry mature ##s and slow ##s .
some even claim the group has become a la ##gging , not leading , indicator .
the ot ##c technology sector is far from a co ##hesive unit .
the group is divided primarily between software , semiconductor ##s and computers .
while computer stocks have taken the biggest hit from the slow ##down in the industry , many software and semiconductor stocks have continued to out ##per ##form the market .
microsoft is up more than 50 % this year , while intel is up more than 40 % .
the broker ##age firm tracks technology stocks with its technology index , which appreciated only 10 . 59 % in the first nine months of this year .
but the firm also tracks smaller technology companies as a subset of the larger group .
yesterday , bank stocks la ##gged behind the overall ot ##c market .
the nas ##da ##q bank index rose 0 . 17 to 43 ##2 . 78 .

on the other hand , mr . jen ##nis ##on noted that the recent slide in bank and th ##rift stocks was at least halted yesterday .
shear ##son , with its in - house order execution system , has handled the bulk of such program trades in the over - the - counter market .

the company has to ##ted up over $ 40 million in contracts in the past two days .

the smoking prohibition remains attached to a $ 27 . 1 billion transportation bill that must still overcome budget obstacles in congress .
but yesterday ' s action put to rest any lingering resistance from tobacco interests .
the sole exceptions are an estimated 30 flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in hawaii and alaska .
assuming final enactment this month , the prohibition will take effect 96 days later , or in early february .
on a 39 ##4 - 21 roll call , the house adopted the underlying transportation measure .
the current ceiling on home loans ins ##ured by the federal housing administration is increased to $ 124 , 875 during fiscal 1990 .
and in anticipation of increased lending , the cap on f ##ha loan guarantees would rise to approximately $ 73 . 8 billion .
this provision met early and strong resistance from investment bankers worried about disruption ##s in their clients ' portfolio ##s .
a string of costly projects , including the high - speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite , would continue to be developed within these limits .
separately , the national science foundation is promised a 7 . 7 % increase to bring its appropriations to $ 2 . 07 billion .
among the subsidies continued in the transportation bill is $ 30 . 7 million to maintain commercial air service for an estimated 92 communities , often in rural areas .
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd - l ##rb - d . , w . va . - rr ##b - strongly resisted deeper cuts sought by the house .
but at a time when the white house wants to kill the entire program , republicans have been among its leading champions .
but given the few number of users , the cost to the federal government per passenger is estimated at $ 193 , according to house and senate appropriations committees .
the same jealousy can breed confusion , however , in the absence of any authorization bill this year .
house and senate app ##rop ##ria ##tors sought to establish a nov . 30 deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed .
the remaining $ 40 million can be used over three years for oil and gas acquisitions , the company said .
the company put up ` ` virtually all ' ' of its oil and gas properties as collateral , he said .

santa fe pacific was the kind of story wall street loved .
since the value of its assets was n ' t known , analysts were free to pick a number .
throw in its railroad , minerals , pipeline and oil assets , he and others argued , and the chicago - based conglomerate should be worth 30 a share .
and why should holders expect to realize that presumed ` ` worth ? ' '
that was another reason the street loved santa fe .
but value , it turns out , is only what a buyer will pay .
and with the company ' s recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real estate , the values suddenly look poorer .
since the real estate unit also includes debt , the imp ##uted value of the real estate itself is close to $ 3 billion .
` ` the upside was in the int ##ang ##ible real estate . . . which is no longer an int ##ang ##ible . ' '
a compromise between bulls and bears puts remaining assets and cash - - including its 44 % stake in its publicly traded pipeline - - at $ 2 billion .
santa fe also has $ 3 . 7 billion in debt .
that nets out to about $ 17 a share for the company on a private market basis .
its plan , instead , is to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets .
but it is n ' t clear why that should be so .
the spin ##off argument , after all , reverse ##s the current notion that assets are worth more to private buyers than to public shareholders .
and real estate usually has n ' t traded well under public ownership .
and what about the cost , and risk , of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values ? ' '
he adds : ` ` if for any reason i do n ' t have the values , then i wo n ' t recommend it . ' '
first boston ' s graeme anne lid ##ger ##wood values santa fe at 24 , down from her earlier estimate of 29 .
her recent report class ##ifies the stock as a ` ` hold . ' '
but it appears to be the sort of hold one makes while heading for the door .
chairman k ##re ##bs says the california pension fund is getting a bargain price that would n ' t have been offered to others .
in other words : the real estate has a higher value than the pending deal suggests .
but as dr ##ex ##el analyst linda dunn notes , its properties will be developed over 15 to 20 years .
so despite wall street ' s rosy talk of quickly ` ` maxim ##izing values , ' ' holders could be in for a long wait .

mr . ed ##elman said the decision ` ` has nothing to do with marty ac ##ker ##man . ' '
mr . ac ##ker ##man contend ##ed that it was a direct response to his efforts to gain control of data ##point .

the big questions are whether the increase , effective jan . 1 , 1990 , will stick , and whether other major steel ##makers will follow suit .
the increase is on the base price , which is already being discount ##ed by virtually all steel producers .
but lt ##v ' s move marks the first effort by a major steel ##maker to counter the free fall in spot prices .
major steel producers are selling cold rolled sheet steel at about $ 370 a ton , compared with a peak price of $ 520 a ton in 1988 .
second - tier companies are receiving even less per ton .
at the same time , steel ##makers are trying to invest more to modern ##ize technology and make themselves more competitive .
but analysts say the company is also trying to prevent further price drops .
both companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with lt ##v and others .
mr . marcus believes spot steel prices will continue to fall through early 1990 and then reverse themselves .
he is n ' t convinced , though , that the price decline reflects falling demand because the world economy remains relatively strong .
it wo n ' t be clear for months whether the price increase will stick .
steel ##makers announced a round of base - price increases last year , but began offering sizable discount ##s over the summer .

democrats want the tax provision to be a separate bill , subject to the usual procedural obstacles .
republicans , meanwhile , want to try to protect the measure by combining it with two politically popular issues that democrats could find hard to block .

democrats want to avoid having to make that choice by making the capital - gains tax cut an individual bill .

both plans would drop child - care provisions from the house version of the deficit - reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill .
senate democrats are to meet today to consider the go ##p proposal .

despite what some investors are suggesting , the big board is n ' t even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures , exchange officials said .
most revisions it will propose will be geared toward slowing down program trading during stress ##ful periods , said officials working with the exchange .

the market ' s tone improved after monday ' s pricing of $ 81 ##3 million new york city general obligation bonds .
the issue ' s smooth absorption eased fears that supply would over ##w ##helm demand in coming sessions , traders said .
demand for the bonds was strong enough to permit under ##writer ##s to trim some yields in the tax - exempt portion of the offering late monday .
the debt was re ##off ##ered priced to yield from 6 % in 1991 to 7 . 15 % in 2008 - 2009 .
his comments were interpreted as a sign that higher interest rates are possible .

after fees and repay ##ment of debt , avery is left with about $ 24 million in cash and securities from the un ##iro ##yal sale .
in over - the - counter trading , avery shares were quoted yesterday at a bid price of 93 . 75 cents a share .

fuji ##tsu ltd . said it wants to withdraw its controversial one - yen bid to design a water ##works computer system for the city of hiroshima .
hiroshima last week held an auction to pick the contractor , expecting to pay about 11 million yen for the project .
eight companies submitted bids , but fuji ##tsu won the contract by essentially saying it would do the job for free .
news of the bid drew sharp criticism from other computer companies and industry observers .
fuji ##tsu itself , which said the bid had n ' t been approved by its headquarters , was clearly embarrassed .
the bid was n ' t ` ` socially acceptable , ' ' a company spoke ##sw ##oman said .
hiroshima officials said they still consider the contract in effect and had no immediate plans to cancel it .
they said they wanted to wait for the outcome of any government investigation before deciding what to do .
the city ' s department of consumer affairs charged new ##mark & lewis inc . with failing to deliver on its promise of lowering prices .

wary investors have been running for the stock market ' s equivalent of bomb shelters , buying shares of gold - mining and utility companies .
those two groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs .
on monday , when a mere seven common stocks managed new highs , six were utilities or gold ##s .
at first glance , gold and utilities seem strange bed ##fell ##ows .
after all , gold prices usually so ##ar when inflation is high .
but the two groups have something very important in common : they are both haven ##s for scared money , stocks for people who hate stocks .
if the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they ' re on firm ##er footing , these stocks might well fall back .
indeed , that happened to some extent yesterday , as industrial stocks rebound ##ed , partly on news of takeover ##s in the paper industry .
still , a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares .
` ` the primary over ##riding thing is that people are frightened , ' ' says martin sas ##s , a new york money manager .
certainly , the oct . 13 sell - off did n ' t settle any stomach ##s .
beyond that , money managers and analysts see other problems .
inventor ##ies are creeping up ; car inventor ##ies are already high , and big auto makers are id ##ling plants .
takeover fever has cooled , removing a major horse from the market ' s cart .
britain ' s un ##sett ##led political scene also worries some investors .
` ` one of the three major markets in the world is getting chewed up pretty bad . ' '
with this sort of sentiment common , it ' s natural for investors to seek out ` ` defensive ' ' investments .
utilities are a classic example : even in recession ##s , people continue to use electric power , water and gas at a fairly steady rate .
such defensive issues as food , tobacco , and drug stocks have been in favor for some time .
but many of these stocks have now become expensive .
gold stocks are n ' t cheap on this basis , either , with many selling for 20 times earnings or more .
even utility stocks are n ' t all that inexpensive , at an average of 14 times earnings .
but the two groups represent a further step in defensive ##ness .
if gold stocks and utilities continue to lead , it may signal that the market is in for rough times .
` ` anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically ir ##res ##pon ##sible .
you do n ' t want to own anything long except gold stocks . ' '
one reason for his gloom is a weekly tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or low ##s .
last friday , 96 stocks on the big board hit new 12 - month low ##s .
but by mr . granville ' s count , 49 ##3 issues were within one point of such low ##s .
mr . st ##ova ##ll does n ' t expect an actual recession .
in such a climate , utility stocks look good to him .
he favors f ##pl group inc . , florida progress corp . , te ##co energy inc . , wisconsin energy corp . , and dominion resources inc .
the appeal of gold issues , mr . st ##ova ##ll says , is that ` ` they ' re a counter group .
you go into them because they move counter to the general market . ' '
he adds that gold stocks had been down so long they were ` ` ready for a bounce . ' '
his favorites are american barr ##ick resources corp . , echo bay mines ltd . and coe ##ur d ' ale ##ne mines corp .
in addition to having high price - earnings ratios , most pay pun ##y divide ##nds , if any .
abby cohen , an investment st ##rate ##gist for dr ##ex ##el burnham lambert , also thinks it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold .
` ` my outlook is for a decline of about 10 % in corporate profits ' ' in 1990 , she says .
but ` ` a bunch of utilities ' ' should post profit increases .
among utilities , dr ##ex ##el currently favors enter ##gy corp . and general public utilities corp .
as for gold , she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak , as it has been lately .
among gold stocks , dr ##ex ##el likes battle mountain gold co . , new ##mont gold co . and free ##port - mc ##mora ##n gold co .
consider the fact that a mere 2 % drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the dna structure .
even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny - wise and pound - foolish .
the reason environmental ##ists ` ` do n ' t mind seeing new crises arise ' ' is because there are new crises .
crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago .
this is a fact and not the product of some environmental doom ##say ##er or a group ' s pl ##oy to create a market .

mr . mel ##lo ##an ' s column was right on the money , but i wish it could have gone one step further .
an important part of my effort has been to understand the science so i can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design .
our concern for the ozone layer , of course , grows out of the potential for increasing uv - b radiation , which could damage flora and fauna .
the last of the measurements reported was in 1985 , but recent conversations with mr . scott ##o indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend .
to me , this calls into question the validity of the rowland - molina theory and hence the whole ch ##lor ##of ##lu ##oro ##carbon ##s replacement effort .
this , in turn , threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written .
to my knowledge , no government entities , including the epa , are pursuing uv - b measurements .
the topic never comes up in ozone ##de ##ple ##tion ` ` establishment ' ' meetings , of which i have attended many .
it seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectual ##ly honest evaluation of the threat posed by cf ##cs .
while recognizing that professional environmental ##ists may feel threatened , i intend to urge that uv - b be monitored whenever i can .

bankers trust new york corp . won permission from the federal reserve board to move the company ' s private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary .
the fed ' s action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks ' securities affiliates will be able to under ##write .

as many as 50 of his employees at specialized bicycle components inc . ride with him .
when they return to their desk ##s at 1 p . m . , they have pedal ##ed 20 miles .
such fe ##r ##vor for cycling helped mr . sin ##yard build a creative company at the forefront of its industry .
founded by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen , specialized spotted the appeal of fat - tired bikes that go almost anywhere and began mass - producing them in 1981 .
in the past five years , the company ' s sales have grown to $ 80 million from $ 26 million .
today , so - called mountain bikes account for two - thirds of the $ 2 billion spent annually on all bicycles in the u . s . .
with 65 % of its sales coming from mountain bikes , specialized is widely considered to be a market leader .
- l ##rb - accessories , largely for mountain - bike users , account for much of the rest of sales . - rr ##b -
but today , the company needs its entrepreneur ##ial spirit more than ever .
at the same time , though , it must become more structured to better manage its growth .
accomplish ##ing both will be a balancing act as challenging as riding a un ##ic ##y ##cle .
it is a problem common to small companies that have grown fast - - especially when their success attracts big - time competitors .
` ` what i hope to bring to this is another word : process .
it ' s mike ' s challenge as well . ' '
` ` we had a lot of problems , ' ' mr . sin ##yard says .
adds mr . e ##ids ##mo , ` ` what felt good that day was done that day . ' '
` ` but it ' s risky , ' ' he says of specialized ' s attempt to adopt a corporate structure .
` ` you do n ' t want to lose the magic ' ' of the company ' s creative drive .
hoping to stay ahead of the pack , the company is emphasizing innovation .
at the trade show , specialized also unveiled a revolutionary three - spoke ##d bike wheel developed jointly by specialized and du pont co .
it currently costs $ 750 , though mr . sin ##yard thinks the price can be reduced within three years to between $ 200 and $ 250 .
he was able to slash the price of the company ' s least expensive mountain bike to $ 279 from $ 750 in
but demands on the company ' s creativity are certain to grow .
competition is int ##ens ##ifying as larger companies invade a mountain - bike market mr . sin ##yard ' s company once had virtually all to itself .
accessories not only sell faster than whole bikes , they also offer profit margins nearly double the 25 % to 30 % or so on sales of complete cycles .
to get a piece of the business , nike inc . , beaver ##ton , ore . , introduced a line of mountain - bike shoes .
competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too .
the segment now makes up roughly two - thirds of his company ' s total sales .
sc ##h ##win ##n bicycle co . , chicago , established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland china and hungary to sell bikes .
in the past year , derby international corp . , luxembourg , has acquired such major brands as peugeot , raleigh and ni ##shi ##ki .
in response to the international ##ization of the business , mr . sin ##yard ' s company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries .
the move will cut out the cost of a middle ##man and give specialized more control over marketing and sales .

september was the 10th consecutive month in which steel exports failed to reach the year - earlier level .
a federation official attributed the decline to brisk demand from domestic industries backed by continuing economic expansion in japan .
japanese steel companies are apparently focusing on domestic sales , but the official said it does n ' t necessarily mean that local sales contracts are increasing that markedly .
` ` they are just too busy to meet domestic demand and have little room for overseas shipments , ' ' the official said .

those rates are up from 7 . 52 % and 7 . 50 % , respectively , at last week ' s auction .
the treasury bills sold yesterday settle today , rather than the standard settlement day of thursday .

the move is sure to height ##en concerns about increased japanese investment in u . s . biotechnology firms .
chu ##gai agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs .
yesterday , in national trading in the over - the - counter market , gen - probe common closed at $ 3 . 25 a share .
` ` the biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors , ' ' said richard god ##own , president of the industrial biotechnology association .
he added that until now the japanese have only acquired equity positions in u . s . biotechnology companies .
` ` they are pig ##gy ##back ##ing onto developed technology , ' ' he said .
during the past five years , japanese concerns have invested in several of the u . s . ' s 43 ##1 independent biotechnology companies .
in 1988 , chu ##gai had net income of $ 60 million on revenue of $ 99 ##1 million .

but after a few pleasant ##ries , the soviets unexpectedly got serious .
the soviets have a world - leading space program , the guests noted .
would n ' t the japanese like a piece of it ?
the visitors then listed technologies up for sale , including launch services and propulsion hardware .
` ` we were just surprised , ' ' says tad ina ##da , nas ##da ' s director for international affairs .
the sales pitch might n ' t be as far ##fe ##tched as it seems .
and , despite its image as a technology super ##power , japan has a lot of weaknesses .
it ' s a world leader in semiconductor ##s , but behind the u . s . in making the computers that use those chips .
one question being debated in the soviet union is how to use the defense sector ' s research - and - production expertise in the rest of the economy .
where they la ##g behind the japanese is in turning the scientific in ##vent ##ive ##ness into improved production .
by contrast , the japanese have proved adept at making use of soviet inventions .
kobe steel ltd . adopted soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its own system .
kawasaki steel corp . bought a soviet steel - casting patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the soviets .
in 1991 , the soviets will take a japanese journalist into space , the first japanese to go into orbit .
soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad do n ' t appear to worry the u . s . , japan ' s principal ally .
` ` we have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the soviet union , ' ' says a state department official .
` ` frankly , i would n ' t expect the japanese to get hooked on anybody ' s technology , least of all the soviets . ' '
under mikhail go ##rba ##chev ' s pere ##st ##roi ##ka , the soviets have sought economic ties all over the world , including new export markets .
the soviets held export exhibitions that included high - tech items in new york and west germany .
last week , a soviet delegation came to japan to push more space technologies .
in august , representatives of kei ##dan ##ren , japan ' s largest business organization , visited moscow to explore exports and investments that would help the soviet economy .
out of the blue , the soviet chamber of commerce handed over details on 59 technologies that the japanese might want to buy .
but , while the soviets ca n ' t expect direct technology flow from japan , they also hope to benefit from japanese manufacturing expertise .
even if the japanese find soviet technology desirable , such discussions would be fra ##ught with political complications .
so far , the soviets have provided only the sketch ##iest information about their technology and business plans .
and what they have shown is n ' t impressive .

may 1 , 1975 , signaled a distress ##ful may day for securities houses , which were forced to end 183 years of charging fixed commissions .
it took effect after seven years of bitter debate between the securities and exchange commission and traders and exchanges .
institutions had become active market players in the early 1970s and sought exchange seats to handle their own trades .
and the industry was ri ##fe with broker ##s trying to secure big client orders by using kick ##backs , gifts , women and junk ##ets .
ray garrett jr . , sec chairman , said the ` ` breadth and depth of the discount ##ing is more than i expected . ' '
even a federal measure in june allowing houses to add research fees to their commissions did n ' t stop it .
the change prompted the rise of discount broker ##s and a reduction in securities research firms .
but there are currently more exchange members than in 1975 , with the bigger houses gaining a larger share of total commissions .
commissions , however , account for a smaller share of investment - house business as takeover advisory fees have soared .
foreign stock markets , with which the u . s . is en ##twined , also have ended fixed commissions in recent years .
paris is currently ph ##asi ##ng out fixed commissions under its ` ` le petit bang ' ' plan .
mr . bush announced several weeks ago that he intended to send such a mission , composed of top government aide ##s and business and labor leaders .
the mission will visit poland from nov . 29 to dec . 2 , the white house said .
michael bo ##skin , chairman of the council of economic advisers , also will be a member .
mr . bush said the group is to ` ` focus on economic sectors where u . s . expertise and cooperation can indeed make a difference . ' '
warner and mr . az ##off declined comment , as did mca , where mr . az ##off had also been discussing such a venture .
among other things , they said , mr . az ##off would develop musical acts for a new record label .
although mr . az ##off wo n ' t produce films at first , it is possible that he could do so later , the sources said .
for warner , meanwhile , it gives the company a second young partner with a finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in the music business .
but mr . az ##off had been negotiating for more than a year to get out of his mca contract , which expired in 1991 .
mr . az ##off reportedly was bored and frequently clashed with top mca management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans .
mr . az ##off also was eager to return to a more entrepreneur ##ial role in which he had a big financial stake in his own efforts .
in an interview at the time of his resignation from mca , he said : ` ` i ' d rather build a company than run one .
tom panel ##li had a perfectly good reason for not using the $ 300 rowing machine he bought three years ago .
the sore ##ness , he admits , went away about a week after the shot .
yet the rowing machine has n ' t been touched since , even though he has moved it across the country with him twice .
i ' m ashamed i own the stupid thing . ' '
the rope ##r organization , which conducted the survey , said almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it dull ##er than they expected .
it is n ' t just exercise gear that is n ' t getting a good workout .
the fitness cr ##az ##e itself has gone soft , the survey found .
fewer people said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , tennis , swimming and aero ##bic ##s .
half of those surveyed said they simply walk these days for exercise .
that ' s good news for market ##ers of walking shoes .
the survey also detected a bit more interest in golf , a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers .
but even that group knows some people do n ' t use their machines as much as they should .
` ` the first excuse is they do n ' t have enough time , ' ' says research director thomas doyle .
` ` the second is they do n ' t have enough discipline . ' '
still , the average price of such bikes rose last year to $ 145 .
mr . doyle predict ##s a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices .
prem ##ark international inc . , for example , pe ##ddle ##s the m ##8 . 7 ##sp electronic cycling simulator , a $ 2 , 000 stationary cycle .
she ' s trying to sell a $ 150 exercise bike she bought about five years ago for her roommate .
` ` i ' m using it a lot , ' ' she says .
` ` i spent so much money that if i look at it , and i ' m not on it , i feel guilty . ' '
the poll points up some inc ##ons ##iste ##ncies between what people say and what they do .
a surprising 78 % of people said they exercise regularly , up from 73 % in 1981 .
this con ##jure ##s up images of a nation full of trim , muscular folks , and suggests couch potatoes are out of season .
of course , that is n ' t really the case .
the disc ##re ##pan ##cy may be because asking people about their fitness regime is a bit like in ##qui ##ring about their love life .
` ` it ' s hard to know if people are responding truth ##fully .
people are too embarrassed to say they have n ' t done anything . ' '
that target has been revised to 30 % by the year 2000 .
time pressures and the e ##bb of the fitness fa ##d are cited as reasons for the decline .
only walking and golf increased in popularity during the 1980s - - and only slightly .
it ' s an activity she feels she can do for life , and by pulling a golf cart , she still gets a good workout .
` ` i ' m really wiped out after walking five hours , ' ' she says .
most people said they exercise both for health and enjoyment .
sometimes , if you have a headache , you can go out and walk it right off . ' '
only about a quarter of the respondents said they exercise to lose weight .
` ` working with lawyers , ' ' she says , ` ` i need it . ' '
but fully 90 % of those polled felt they did n ' t need to belong to a health club .
` ` the guys are being mach ##o , and the girls are walking around in little things .
they ' re not there to work out . ' '
nearly half of those who joined health clubs said they did n ' t use their membership as often as they planned .
feeling they should devote more time to their families or their jobs , many yu ##pp ##ies are skipping their once - sacred workout .
there are die - hard bodies , of course .
` ` the emotional aspect is so draining , they needed a good workout . ' '
perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling alley may be an endangered american institution .
the survey reported the number of people who said they bowl regularly has fallen to just 8 % from 17 % in 1981 .
the american bowling congress claims a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly , but con ##cede ##s its membership has declined this decade .
to find out why , the group recently commissioned a study of the past 20 years of bowling - related research .
people who start bowling expecting it to be a pleas ##urable exercise ` ` have been generally disappointed , ' ' the report said .
but not richard cot ##tre ##ll , a san francisco cab driver who bowls in two weekly leagues .
he hit the lanes three years ago on the advice of his doctor .
` ` it ' s good exercise , ' ' he says .
` ` i ca n ' t do anything score - wise , but i like meeting the girls . ' '

private housing starts in japan were unchanged in september from a year earlier at 144 , 610 units , the construction ministry said .
the flat report followed a four - month string of declines .
the down trend was partly the result of tighter credit sparked by a discount rate increase by the bank of japan in may .

when it comes to bust ##ing ghosts , the monroe , con ##n . , couple are perfect demons .
they claim to have busted spirits , pol ##ter ##ge ##ists and other sp ##ook ##s in hundreds of houses around the country .
they say they now get three or four ` ` legitimate ' ' calls a week from people ha ##rrie ##d by haunt ##s .
a professional magician and musician , he heads the pittsburgh branch of the committee for the scientific investigation of the paranormal .
mr . busch says there is a scientific explanation for all haunt ##s , and he can even tell you how to encourage the spirits .
` ` all you have to do is eat a big pizza , and then go to bed , ' ' he says .
` ` you ' ll have weird dreams , too . ' '
either way , the ghost ##bus ##ting business is going like gang ##bus ##ters .
tales of haunt ##s and horrors are pro ##life ##rating beyond the nation ' s elm streets and ami ##ty ##ville ##s .
the committee , formed in 1967 , now has 60 chapters around the world .
the spirits , of course , could hardly care less whether people do or do n ' t believe in them .

mr . baker says he has personally best ##ed more than 50 haunt ##s , from aliens to pol ##ter ##ge ##ists .

mr . baker drives a 1987 chevy and usually wears a tweed jacket on his ghost ##bus ##ting for ##ays .

when a louisville woman complained that a ghost was haunting her attic , mr . baker discovered a rat dragging a trap across the raft ##ers .
a foul - smelling demon supposedly plagued a house in manning ##ton , ky .
mr . baker found an opening under the house that led to a fu ##me - filled coal mine .
when the weather cool ##s , mr . baker says , ho ##bos often hole up in abandoned houses .
` ` people see activity in there , and the next thing you know , you ' ve got a haunting , ' ' he says .
mr . baker hears her out , poke ##s around a bit , asks a few questions and proposes some explanations .
the flying telephone : ` ` you tangle the base cord around a chair leg , and the receiver does seem to fly off . ' '
the ghostly footsteps : ` ` interstate 64 is a block away , and heavy traffic can sure set a house to vibrating . ' '
` ` i ' m not sure he ' s explained everything , ' ' mrs . st ##inn ##ett says gr ##ud ##gingly .
` ` there are some things that have gone on here that nobody can explain , ' ' she says .
mr . baker promises to return if the haunting continues .
for especially stubborn haunt ##s , mr . baker carries a secret weapon , a vial of corn ##star ##ch .

by some estimates , brazil ' s internal debt , or combined public deficit , could reach 6 . 5 % of its $ 351 billion gross domestic product .
much of the money goes into subsidies or keeping in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt state - controlled companies operating .

which is the best medicine for runaway health costs : competition or regulation ?
the battle focuses on the state ' s certificate - of - need law , which regulates investment in new medical technology .
the law has prevented $ 216 million of unnecessary expenditures since 1986 , according to william s . con ##n , president of the kentucky hospital association .
but according to david jones , human ##a ' s chief executive , it promotes technology mono ##pol ##ies , st ##if ##les innovation and raises prices .
the company complain ##s that it paid $ 10 million to non - human ##a hospitals in its latest fiscal year for services provided to its insurance plan members .
but human ##a says its own facilities could serve its ins ##ured for less if they were properly equipped .
mr . con ##n charges that human ##a ' s own actions undermine its argument .
human ##a contend ##s that $ 8 , 000 represents an extreme case and that its regular charge for lit ##hot ##rip ##sy is $ 4 , 900 .
human ##a , which wants to acquire one of the new machines itself , is on the record as opposed to the proposal .

nr ##m energy co . said it filed materials with the securities and exchange commission calling for it to rest ##ru ##cture into a corporation from a limited partnership .
the partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding .
nr ##m suspended its common distribution in june 1988 and the distribution on its $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in september .
ed ##isto currently is the general partner of nr ##m .
as the largest holder of acquisition preferred units , mesa limited partnership would own about 28 % of ed ##isto after the transaction .
the transaction is subject to approval of nr ##m unit ##holders of record on oct . 23 , among other conditions .
nr ##m said it expects unit ##holders to vote on the restructuring at a meeting dec . 15 .

after hitting two - year highs this summer , net sales of stock funds slowed in september , according to the investment company institute , a trade group .
the sales recovery sc ##ree ##ched to a halt this month , some analysts say .
net sales of stock funds in september totaled $ 83 ##9 . 4 million , down from $ 1 . 1 billion in august , the institute said .
but if rein ##ves ##ted divide ##nds are excluded , investors put in only $ 340 million more than they pulled out for the month .
october ' s numbers , which wo n ' t be released for a month , are down further , mutual fund executives say .
investors in stock funds did n ' t panic the weekend after mid - october ' s 190 - point market plunge .
most of the those who left stock funds simply switched into money market funds .
and some fund groups said investors actually became net buyers .
the recent out ##cr ##y over program trading will cast a pal ##l over the stock - fund environment in the coming months , some analysts say .
` ` the public is very close to having had it , ' ' mr . jenks says .
investors pulled back from bond funds in september , too .
net sales of bond funds for the month totaled $ 1 . 1 billion , down two - thirds from $ 3 . 1 billion in august .
the major reason : heavy out ##flow ##s from high - risk , high - yield junk bond funds .
big withdrawal ##s from the junk funds have continued this month .
many small investors went for the safety of money market funds .
assets of these and other short - term funds surged more than $ 5 billion in september , the institute said .
analysts say additional investors transferred their assets into money funds this month .
at fidelity investments , the nation ' s largest fund group , money funds continue to draw the most business , says michael hines , vice president , marketing .
in october , net sales of stock funds at fidelity dropped sharply , mr . hines said .
but he emphasized that new accounts , new sales , inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from september ' s level .
investor interest in stock funds ` ` has n ' t stalled at all , ' ' mr . hines maintains .
he notes that most of the net sales drop stemmed from a three - day period following the friday the 13th plunge .
` ` if that follows through next month , then it will be a different story , ' ' he says .
one trend that continues is growth in the money invested in funds .
stock - fund managers , meantime , went into october with less cash on hand than they held earlier this year .
large cash positions help buffer funds from market declines but can cut down on gains in rising markets .
managers of junk funds were bo ##lster ##ing their cash ho ##ards after the september cash crunch at camp ##eau corp .
junk - portfolio managers raised their cash position to 9 . 4 % of assets in september from 8 . 3 % in august .
in september 1988 , that level was 9 . 5 % .
investors in all funds will seek safety in the coming months , some analysts say .
among stock funds , the conservative growth - and - income portfolio ##s probably will remain popular , fund specialists say .
we keep wondering what mr . gates wanted to say .
perhaps he ' d have called for ` ` a decent ##ral ##ized political and economic system ' ' without a dominant communist party .
or political arrangements ` ` to alleviate the gr ##ie ##vances and demands of soviet ethnic minorities and republics . ' '
why , a bob gates might even have said , ` ` nor are soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant western credits . ' '
it ' s somehow ok for secretary baker himself , however , to say all the same things .
in fact , he did ; the quotes above are from mr . baker ' s speech of two weeks ago .
perhaps mr . gates would emphasize more than mr . baker the many hurdles the soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed .
but everyone agrees that mr . go ##rba ##chev ' s problems result from the failure of his own system .
they can be relieved only by changing that system , not by pouring western money into it .

yet much of the political culture seems intent on cast ##iga ##ting the bush administration for not ` ` helping ' ' mr . go ##rba ##chev .
mr . baker seems especially sensitive to the washington ai ##lm ##ent known as belt ##way - it ##is .
letting officials express their own nu ##ances can be educational .
it is in the western interest to see mr . go ##rba ##chev succeed .
the odds are against him , as he himself would no doubt tell you .
the ultimate outcome depends on what he does , not on what we do .
even if the press is ready to seize and mis ##int ##er ##pre ##t , these are not very complicated thoughts .
surely there is someone in the administration , maybe bob gates , who could explain them to college students , or even school ##child ##ren .

most murders are state crimes , so any federal capital - punishment law probably would turn out to be more symbolism than substance .
yet the bill is riding high on the fur ##or over drug trafficking .
senate republicans , after repeatedly failing to attach death - penalty amendments to unrelated legislation , have finally gotten a full - blown death - penalty bill through committee .
even some democrats con ##cede that there is probably a majority in the senate that favors some kind of broad capital - punishment measure .
in 1972 , the high court swept aside all capital - punishment laws - - federal and state alike - - as unconstitutional .
but in 1976 , the court permitted resurrection of such laws , if they meet certain procedural requirements .
since that 1976 ruling , 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty .
among these crimes are murder on federal land , presidential assassination and espionage .
the th ##ur ##mond bill would also add five new crimes punish ##able by death , including murder for hire .
- l ##rb - separately , the senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of terrorists who kill americans abroad . - rr ##b -
for one thing , it ' s unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences , let alone be executed .
` ` in that sense , the whole debate is sort of a fraud , ' ' argues a democratic senate staff member .
` ` it ' s distracting attention from serious issues , like how to make dea , fbi and customs work together ' ' on drug enforcement .
republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the th ##ur ##mond bill , but they contend that is n ' t the point .
executions , regardless of how frequently they occur , are also ` ` proper retribution ' ' for he ##ino ##us crimes , mr . hatch argues .
the amendment prompted an ironic protest from mr . th ##ur ##mond , who complained that it would ` ` kill ' ' capital punishment .
a large number of studies suggest that state judges and ju ##ries have imposed the penalty in a racial ##ly disc ##rim ##inatory fashion .
and the kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencing ##s , in two important ways .
it would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racial ##ly di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ate application of the death penalty in the past .
and it would shift the burden to prosecutors to di ##sp ##rove that discrimination caused any statistical racial di ##spar ##ities .
` ` that burden is very difficult , if not impossible , to meet , ' ' says mr . boyd .
` ` how do you prove a negative ? ' '
the kennedy amendment would , in effect , leg ##is ##late around the supreme court ruling .
but if it survives , it could prompt other statutory changes , according to the mr . burr .
narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever deter ##rent effect it now has .
and that , in turn , would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances .

in an interview with the trade journal automotive news , mr . ia ##co ##cca declined to say which plants will close or when chrysler will make the moves .
but he said , ` ` we have too many plants in our system .
so the older or most in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt capacity has got to go . ' '
chrysler has had to temporarily close the st . louis and toledo plants recently because of excess inventor ##ies of vehicles built there .
but mr . ia ##co ##cca ' s remarks are the most specific indication to date of how many plants could be in jeopardy .
the over ##cap ##ac ##ity problem has intensified in recent years , with foreign auto makers beginning car and truck production in the u . s . .
already chrysler has closed the ken ##osh ##a , wi ##s . , plant it acquired when it bought american motors corp . in 1987 .
rev ##co reacted cautiously , saying the plan would add $ 260 million of new debt to the highly leverage ##d company .
those rights prevent anyone other than rev ##co from proposing a reorganization plan .
also under chapter 11 , a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bond ##holders , banks and other creditors .
a financial adviser for rev ##co bond ##holders , david sc ##hul ##te , of chi ##lma ##rk partners , had mixed reactions to the offer .
however , the group is offering to pay off bond ##holders in cash only - - $ 260 . 5 million - - and no equity .
rev ##co received the offer oct . 20 , but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bond ##holders .
ac ##adia partners limited partnership , a fort worth , texas , partnership that includes the robert m . bass group , made the proposal .
analysts said the nation ' s second - largest drugs ##tore chain was a valuable company , despite its financial wo ##es .
sales were $ 59 ##7 . 8 million , up 2 . 4 % from the previous year .
ac ##adia partners and the bass group declined to comment .
the partnership also includes american express co . , e ##quitable life assurance society of the u . s . and shear ##son lehman hutton inc .
the offer consists of $ 410 . 5 million in cash and the rest in notes .
he said he has not met with representatives from ac ##adia .
rev ##co has $ 1 . 5 billion in claims outstanding .
we just want a plan that sat ##is ##fies creditors and at the end leaves a healthy rev ##co . ' '
but mr . sc ##hul ##te , the bond ##holders ' adviser , said rev ##co was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal .
` ` they want to pretend it does n ' t exist , ' ' he said .
mr . sc ##hul ##te , who met with ac ##adia representatives on oct . 10 , said , ` ` it ' s certainly a responsible offer .
it ' s not an effort to steal the company ' ' in the middle of the night .
copper futures prices failed to extend friday ' s rally .
declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down .
futures prices fell during three of five sessions last week , and the losses , individually and cumulative ##ly , were greater than the advances .
the mint purchases were at premium ##s about 4 1 \ / 2 cents a pound above the respective prices for the copper .
at the time merchants were asking for premium ##s of about five cents a pound .
all this has led to prolonged selling in futures , mostly on the part of computer - guided funds .
prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas , which added to the selling .
the reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply .
at least one analyst noted that as production improves , the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies .
japan normally depends heavily on the highland valley and can ##ane ##a mines as well as the bo ##uga ##in ##ville mine in papua new guinea .
but as highland valley and can ##ane ##a begin operating , they are expected to resume their roles as japan ' s suppliers .
the bo ##uga ##in ##ville mine is generally expected to remain closed until at least the end of the year .
it has n ' t been operating since may 15 because of attacks by native landowners .
a recent attempt to resume operations was cut short quickly by these attacks .
however , traders disregard ##ed a potential production disruption in chile and a continued drop in inventor ##ies .
the mines produced a total of 110 , 000 tons of copper in 1988 .
another analyst said that , if there was any concern , it was that a strike could encourage other walk ##outs in chile .
london metal exchange copper inventor ##ies fell 550 tons last week to 83 , 950 tons , a smaller - than - expected decline .
but that development also had little effect on traders ' sentiment .
the high point of foreigners ' copper stocks this year was 136 , 000 tons at the end of april , according to mr . dem ##ler .
futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved .
the december contract ended with a gain of 1 . 29 cents a pound at 74 . 35 cents .

futures prices showed modest changes in light trading volume .
december delivery gold eased 40 cents an ounce to $ 380 . 80 .
december silver was off 3 . 7 cents an ounce at $ 5 . 283 ##0 .
january platinum rose 90 cents an ounce at $ 500 . 20 .
the market turned quiet after rising sharply late last week , according to one analyst .
last week ' s uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety , he said , but yesterday the market lacked such stimuli .
there was some profit - taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance , he said .
the dollar was also slightly firm ##er and prompted some selling , as well , according to the analyst .
the forest - products concern currently has about 38 million shares outstanding .

indeed , the soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that mr . go ##rba ##chev must proceed with economic reform .
but is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run up ##hill ?
and has he truly persuaded the communist party to accept economic change of a kind that will , sooner or later , lead to its demise ?
before becoming self - employed , or setting up a cooperative , workers must seek permission from the local soviet - l ##rb - council - rr ##b - .
permission is far from automatic : the soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions , and they appear to be exercising these powers .
private dress ##making , for example , is allowed in 10 soviet republics but banned by five ; shoe ##making is allowed in seven but illegal in nine .
the controls on cooperative ##s appeared relatively liberal when first introduced .
all independent media activity is now illegal , which perhaps is not surprising , but so is the manufacture of perfume , cosmetics , household chemicals and sand candles .
if mr . go ##rba ##chev is looking toward un ##lea ##shing the productive forces of the market , these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless .
mr . go ##rba ##chev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods .
most important , this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely und ##ist ##urbed .
they , too , promised to combine economic efficiency with order and discipline .
by contrast , a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause , rather than resolve , conflict .
in doing so , he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market .
the latter would be undertaken by ` ` enterprises , joint stock companies and cooperative ##s . ' '
these would not function independently , but would act together to form ` ` combines , unions and associations ' ' to tackle problems and coordinate their activities .
the soviet communist party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it .
however , mr . go ##rba ##chev must ensure that within this ` ` alliance ' ' the business sector remains subordinate to the party .
at the same time , he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed .
it is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corp ##ora ##tist model attractive to both the party and labor .
the work force provides the third arm of the ` ` alliance . ' '
at the same time , the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine western - style political plural ##ism .
it is possible that , in per ##pet ##uating such myths , the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism .

a final ratings tally from a . c . nielsen co . is due today .
the network had been expected to have losses of as much as $ 20 million on baseball this year .
it is n ' t clear how much those losses may widen because of the short series .
abc had based its budget for baseball on a six - game series .
a network spokesman would n ' t comment , and abc sports officials declined to be interviewed .
cbs sports president neal pi ##lson has conceded only that cbs will have a loss in the first year .
the series typically is among the highest - rated sports events on television .
abc ' s hurdle was even higher this year with two teams from the same area .
then came the earthquake and a damaging delay of 11 days .
some people had hoped abc ' s ratings would go up because of the intense focus on the event in the aftermath of the earthquake .
an analyst ' s opinion to that effect even sent capital cities \ / abc shares soaring two weeks ago .
the third game , last friday night , drew a disappointing 17 . 5 rating .
bargain hunters helped stock prices break a week ##long losing streak while bond prices and the dollar inched higher .
the dow jones industrial average gained 6 . 76 points to 260 ##3 . 48 in light trading after losing more than 92 points last week .
bond prices continued to edge higher in anticipation of more news showing a slower economy .
yet that did n ' t eliminate program trading from the market .
but interest wan ##ed as the day wore on and investors looked ahead to the release later this week of two important economic reports .
the first is wednesday ' s survey of purchasing managers , considered a good indicator of how the nation ' s manufacturing sector fare ##d in october .
the other is friday ' s measure of october employment , an indicator of the broader economy ' s health .
both are expected to show continued slug ##gis ##hn ##ess , which would be good for bonds and bad for stocks .

now , the personal - computer revolution is finally reaching japan .
in april , the long - term credit bank linked its computers in tokyo with its three american offices .
overall , pc sales in japan in the first half of 1989 were 34 % higher than in the year - earlier period .
and with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency , more and more japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice .
` ` we have too many people in our home offices , ' ' says yo ##shi ##o hat ##ake ##yama , the president of the japan management association .
` ` productivity in japanese offices is relatively low . ' '
but it also offers opportunities ; americans are well poised to supply the weapons .
japan may be a tough market for outsiders to penetrate , and the u . s . is hopeless ##ly behind japan in certain technologies .
but for now , at least , americans are far better at making pcs and the software that runs them .
after years of talking about selling in japan , more and more u . s . companies are seriously pouring in .
apple computer inc . has doubled its staff here over the past year .
lotus development corp . has slashed the la ##g between u . s . and japan product introductions to six months from three years .
un ##ger ##mann - bass inc . has a bigger share of the computer - network market in japan than at home .
but the japanese have to go a long way to catch up .
typical is one office of the ministry of international trade and industry ' s machinery and information industries bureau - - the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry .
` ` personal computer ' ' yearbook ##s are lined up on nearly every desk , and dog - ear ##ed copies of nik ##kei computer crowd magazine racks .
but amid the two dozen bureau ##crats and secretaries sits only one real - life pc .
japanese office workers use pcs at half the rate of their european counterparts and one - third that of the americans .
moreover , japanese offices tend to use computers less efficiently than american offices do .
in the u . s . , pcs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network .
in japan , many desktop terminals are limited to one function and ca n ' t communicate with other machines .
but the machines are n ' t on employees ' desk ##s ; they ring the perimeter of the large office .
to transfer information from one to the other , employees make print ##outs and enter the data manually .
to transmit charts to branch offices , they use a fa ##x machine .
in an efficient setup , the same pc could perform all those tasks .
in the u . s . , more than half the pc software sold is either for spreads ##hee ##ts or for database analysis , according to lotus .
in japan , those functions account for only about a third of the software market .
machines dedicated solely to word processing , which have all but disappeared in the u . s . , are still more common in japan than pcs .
in the u . s . , one - fifth of the office pcs are hooked up to some sort of network .
but healthy skepticism is only a small reason for japan ' s pc la ##g .
top japanese executives often make decisions based on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy presentations .
and japan ' s management system makes it hard to impose a single , integrated computer system corporate ##wide .
until recently , much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least una ##ff ##ord ##able .
some analysts estimate the average pc costs about 50 % more in japan than the u . s . .
but the complex language is n ' t the only reason .
for the past decade , nec corp . has owned more than half the japanese pc market and ruled it with near - monopoly power .
with little competition , the computer industry here is in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt .
the u . s . market , too , is dominated by a giant , international business machines corp .
but early on , ibm offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it .
dozens of small companies did , swiftly establishing a standard operating system .
that is the state of japan ' s computer industry .
meanwhile , the big players have n ' t tried to copy the nec standard .
corporate pride as well as the close ties common among japanese manufacturers help explain why .
most rivals ` ` have a working relationship with nec , often through cross - licensing of technology , ' ' the japan personal computer software association noted recently .
the result , according to many analysts , is higher prices and less innovation .
a year ago , japan ' s fair trade commission warned nec about possible violations of anti - monopoly laws for disco ##ura ##ging retailers from discount ##ing .
` ` there are no price wars , no competition . ' '
she adds that some technological advances trail those in the u . s . because the japanese still import basic operating systems from american companies .
the government is funding several projects to push pc use .
over the next three years , public schools will get 1 . 5 million pcs , a 15 - fold increase from current levels .
in the private sector , practically every major company is setting explicit goals to increase employees ' exposure to computers .
` ` managers have long been those who supervise their subordinate ##s so orders would be properly acted on , ' ' a spokesman says .
meanwhile , more computer makers now are competing for the new business .
se ##iko eps ##on corp . , a newcomer to the industry , fought off a legal challenge and started selling nec clones last year .
it has won about 15 % of the retail pc market .
in a country where elbow room is scarce , laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry ' s future growth .
many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard .
two years ago , most of the smaller makers joined under the microsoft corp . umbrella to adopt a version of the american ibm at standard .
a healthy , coherent japanese market could also make it far easier for japanese companies to sell overseas , where their share is still minimal .
but it could also help american companies , which also are starting to try to open the market .
as with many other goods , the american share of japan ' s pc market is far below that in the rest of the world .
u . s . makers have under 10 % share , compared with half the market in europe and 80 % at home .
though no formal trade barriers exist , the japanese computer industry is difficult for outsiders to enter .
his company , without any major effort , sells more machines in china than in japan .
and because general retail centers such as computer ##land have little presence in japan , sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers .
japan ' s ft ##c says it is investigating apple for allegedly disco ##ura ##ging retailers from discount ##ing .
but the u . s . companies are red ##ou ##bling their efforts .
earlier this year , it introduced a much more powerful kan ##ji operating system and a kan ##ji laser printer .
ibm just last year started selling its first machine that could run in both japanese and english and that substantially enhance ##s compatibility with its american products .
` ` but it ' s an enormous business opportunity .
by contrast , surgical abortion is 99 % effective .
abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion .
timing is of the essence with ru - 48 ##6 .
that is typically about a three - week window .
so far , all the studies have concluded that ru - 48 ##6 is ` ` safe . ' '
no one has researched the long - term effects of ru - 48 ##6 on a woman ' s health or fertility .
the drug seems to suppress o ##vu ##lation for three to seven months after it is taken .
some women clearly have no trouble eventually con ##ce ##iving again : the studies have reported repeat ##ers in their programs .
but there are no scientific data on this question .
rather ominous ##ly , rabbit studies reveal that ru - 48 ##6 can cause birth defects , lance ##t , the british medical journal , reported in 1987 .
all the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves ineffective not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion .
one might well ask : why bother with this drug at all ?
some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question .
many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding , which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion .
the health and human services department currently forbid ##s the national institutes of health from funding abortion research as part of its $ 8 million contra ##ceptive program .
following the feminist and population - control lead has been a generally bo ##vine press .
a june 1988 article in mother jones magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance .

on june 30 , a major part of our trade deficit went po ##of !
no figure jug ##gling ; no witchcraft ; just vastly improved recording of some of our exports .
more than half of the ` ` newly found ' ' net exports were from just a few service - sector categories .
nearly 10 years ago , representatives of service - sector companies worked out a plan with the commerce department to improve the data on service - sector exports .
the monthly ` ` trade deficit ' ' figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade : manufactured goods and raw materials .
over time , through bench ##mark surveys , the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered .
these revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar .
the material ##ly smaller trade deficit may have been already discount ##ed in the market .
too early to tell , but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture .

wall street continued to buckle under the public out ##cr ##y against computer - driven program trading .
many investors blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market , including the 190 - point plunge in the dow jones industrial average on oct . 13 .
a specialist is an exchange member designated to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock .
the decision by merrill , the nation ' s largest securities firm , represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading .
most wall street firms , in pulling back , have merely stopped such trading for their own accounts .
merrill has been one of the main firms executing index ar ##bit ##rage for customers .
in stock - index ar ##bit ##rage , traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offset ##ting trades in stock - index futures and options .
the idea is to lock in profits from short - term swings in volatile markets .
` ` we were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions , ' ' he said .
most of kidd ##er ' s program trading is for its own account , according to the new york stock exchange .
kidd ##er denied that ge ' s chairman and chief executive , john f . welch , had anything to do with kidd ##er ' s decision .
kidd ##er has generally been sensitive to suggestions that ge makes decisions for its kidd ##er unit .
` ` our decision had nothing to do with any pressure mr . welch received , ' ' mr . carpenter said .
` ` this was a kidd ##er peabody stand - alone decision . ' '
but merrill lynch , in its statement about pulling out of index ar ##bit ##rage , suggested that the current debate has missed the mark .
merrill said it continues to believe that ` ` the causes of excess market vol ##ati ##lity are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy .
meanwhile , bear ste ##arns chairman and chief executive alan c . greenberg said his firm will continue stock - index ar ##bit ##rage for its clients .
` ` it ' s not going to stop it at all . ' '
pressure from big institutional investors has been the major catalyst for wall street ' s program - trading pull ##back .

please contribute what you can , ' ' the ad said .
within two hours , viewers pledged over $ 400 , 000 , according to a red cross executive .
nissan motor is just one of a sl ##ew of ad ##vert ##iser ##s that have hitch ##ed their ads to the devastating san francisco quake and hurricane hugo .

the high court ' s action , refusing to hear appeals by several drug companies , is likely to have a significant impact at several levels .
the lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who took the drug .
now that the new york decision has been left intact , other states may follow suit .
the appeals involved des , which was approved by the food and drug administration for use from the 1940s until 1971 to prevent mis ##carriage ##s during pregnancy .
in 1971 , the fda banned the use of des after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who took the drug .
lawsuits over the harm caused by des have flooded federal and state courts in the past decade .
under traditional legal theories , inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed .
each company ' s share of liability would be based on their share of the national des market .
the new york court also upheld a state law , passed in 1986 , extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing des lawsuits .
the effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one - year extension .
general dynamics appealed to the high court , backed by numerous business trade groups , arguing that the appeals court definition restrict ##s the defense too severely .
general dynamics was sued by the families of five navy divers who were killed in 1982 after they re - entered a submarine through a diving chamber .
the accident was caused by faulty operation of a valve .

it can be hoped that spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory sunday .
a strong challenge from the far left , the communist coalition i ##z ##qui ##er ##da un ##ida , failed to top ##ple him .
he should consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth - oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left .
if he follows the correct path , he may be able to look back on this election as the high - water mark of far - left opposition .
the far left had some good issues even if it did not have good programs for dealing with them .
it could point to plenty of ai ##lm ##ents that the spanish economic re ##ju ##ven ##ation so far has failed to cure .
unemployment still is officially recorded at 16 . 5 % , the highest rate in europe , although actual job ##lessness may be lower .
housing is scarce and public services - - the court system , schools , mail service , telephone network and the highways - - are in disgrace ##ful condition .
the left also is critical of the style of the socialist government - - a remarkable parallel to the situation in britain .
in response to this , the socialist prime minister has simply cited his free - market accomplishments .
in that time more than 1 . 2 million jobs have been created and the official job ##less rate has been pushed below 17 % from 21 % .
a 14 % inflation rate dropped below 5 % .
net foreign investment through august this year has been running at a pace of $ 12 . 5 billion , about double the year - earlier rate .
mr . gonzalez is not quite a closet supply - side revolutionary , however .
he did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions ; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes .
he should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income , in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher , not lower , revenues .
he could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers , thus making funds available for public services starved of money for six years .
the voters delivered mr . gonzalez a third mandate for his successes .
they , as well as numerous latin american and east european countries that hope to adopt elements of the spanish model , are supporting the direction spain is taking .
it would be sad for mr . gonzalez to abandon them to app ##ease his foe ##s .

medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes which , if damaged , un ##lea ##sh the chaotic growth of cells that character ##izes cancer .
scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops .
an emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention .
` ` only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level .
scientists call the new class of genes tumor - suppress ##ors , or simply anti - cancer genes .
when functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell ' s growth in check .
the newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called on ##co ##gen ##es .
like all genes , tumor - suppress ##or genes are inherited in two copies , one from each parent .
either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired .
bill and bonnie quinlan are among the first ben ##ef ##icia ##ries of the new findings .
` ` it made our new year , ' ' says mr . quinlan .
this test was the first to predict re ##lia ##bly whether an individual could expect to develop cancer .
to date , scientists have fingered two of these cancer - suppress ##ors .
dr . dry ##ja made his re ##tino ##bla ##sto ##ma discovery in 1986 .
then last spring , researchers reported finding a gene called p ##53 which , if impaired , turns healthy colon cells cancer ##ous .
soon after that report , two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p ##53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers .
colon , lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease , collectively killing almost 200 , 000 americans a year .
he theo ##rized that in the eye cancer , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other .
the tumor , he suggested , developed when the second , normal copy also was damaged .
but there was no way to prove dr . kn ##ud ##son ' s ` ` two - hit ' ' theory .
under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing .
he assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer .
but he did n ' t know which gene or genes had disappeared .
then , a scientific team led by molecular genetic ##ist webster cave ##nee , then at the university of utah , found the answer .
it was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer .
` ` it was extra ##ord ##ina ##rily satisfying , ' ' says dr . kn ##ud ##son , now at fox chase cancer research center in philadelphia .
` ` i was convinced that what was true of re ##tino ##bla ##sto ##ma would be true for all cancers . ' '
his was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called wil ##m ' s tumor .
dr . vogel ##stein next turned his attention to colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the u . s . after lung cancer .
he believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple ` ` hits ' ' on cancer suppress ##or genes , because it often seems to develop in stages .
gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged .
if both copies of a certain gene were knocked out , benign poly ##ps would develop .
if both copies of a second gene were then deleted , the poly ##ps would progress to mali ##gnan ##cy .
it was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop .
their report gal ##vani ##zed other molecular biologist ##s .
such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene .
when they found it last winter , dr . vogel ##stein was dubious that the search was over .
the del ##eti ##on dr . vogel ##stein found was in exactly the same spot as p ##53 .
but mr . levine had said the p ##53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth , whereas the johns hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth .
evidence now is emerging that the p ##53 suppress ##or gene is involved in other cancers , too .
the p ##53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer .
there also are reports from several labs , as yet unpublished , of missing p ##53 genes in tissue taken from kidney , brain and skin cancers .
at the same time , the johns hopkins team and others are rushing to pin ##point other tumor - suppress ##or genes .
dr . vogel ##stein hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 , also involved in colon cancer .
dr . min ##na believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer .
where these discoveries will lead , scientists can only spec ##ulate .
some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppress ##or proteins normally produced by the genes .
the idea would be to administer to patients the growth - controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes .
it may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions , though no one has come close to doing that so far .
many investors give michael foods about as much chance of getting it together as hum ##pt ##y dump ##ty .
but now at least there ' s a g ##lim ##mer of hope for the stock .
burger king , which breaks thousands of fresh eggs each morning , is quietly switching over to an alternative egg product made by michael foods .
known as easy eggs , the product has disappointed investors .
when the company this month announced lower - than - forecast sales of easy eggs , the stock dropped nearly 19 % .
michael wo n ' t confirm the identities of any easy egg customers , nor will it say much of anything else .
two minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making ` ` various un ##tr ##ue statements . ' '
but at least burger king has signed on , and says that by year end it wo n ' t be using any shell eggs .
the miami fast - food chain , owned by grand metropolitan of britain , expects to consume roughly 34 million pounds of li ##que ##fied eggs annually .
- l ##rb - easy eggs are paste ##urized in a heat - using process . - rr ##b -
but burger king operators independently confirm using michael ' s product .
other institutional users reportedly include marriott , which is moving away from fresh eggs on a region - by - region basis .
the extent of marriott ' s use is n ' t known , and marriott officials could n ' t be reached for comment .
the ceo , richard g . olson , replied ` ` yes , ' ' but would n ' t elaborate .
- l ##rb - the company did n ' t put out a public announcement .
a spokesman said later that mr . olson was being ` ` conservative ' ' in his estimate .
analyst robin young of john kin ##nard & co . , minneapolis , calls himself ` ` the last remaining bull on the stock . ' '
earnings are n ' t keeping pace , he says , because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and drought - related costs in its potato business .
company president steve pa ##pet ##ti says marriott will be among his clients as well .
michael shares closed at 13 3 \ / 4 yesterday in national over - the - counter trading .
says new york - based short seller mark co ##ho ##des , ` ` in my mind this is a $ 7 stock . ' '
michael late yesterday announced a $ 3 . 8 million stock buy - back program .
michael , which also processes potatoes , still relies on sp ##ud ##s for about a fourth of its sales and nearly half its pre ##ta ##x profit .
but dry growing conditions in the red river valley of minnesota and north dakota are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what michael contracted to pay last spring .
still , analysts believe that profit margins in the potato business will be down again this year .
the printing customers that quebec ##or will gain through maxwell graphics include the sunday newspaper supplement parade , time , sports illustrated and tv guide .
analysts say quebec ##or ' s purchase is part of a trend toward consolidation in the north american printing industry .
he adds : ` ` i think this is a great strategic move for quebec ##or .
they are buying an operation that is running well . ' '
mr . pe ##lad ##eau says he is n ' t trying to catch up to donnell ##ey , which has annual sales of over $ 3 billion .
` ` size does n ' t matter , ' ' mr . pe ##lad ##eau says .
` ` what counts is the bottom line . ' '
quebec ##or started the philadelphia journal , a daily tabloid , in 1977 and closed it three years later .
the venture cost quebec ##or $ 12 million , mr . pe ##lad ##eau says .
more recently , some former quebec ##or executives started their own printing company , specializing in printing and distributing advertising circular ##s .
quebec ##or still la ##gs in the quebec circular ##s market , while mr . pe ##lad ##eau ' s former employees are expanding across canada .
the tabloid ' s circulation soared to 80 , 000 , but plunged to under 10 , 000 when the la press ##e strike ended .
still , mr . pe ##lad ##eau stuck with the venture .
mr . pe ##lad ##eau has never made any apologies for publishing the tabloid , a bra ##sh mix of crime and sports .
` ` i ' ve read bal ##za ##c , ' ' he answers critics .
` ` it ' s tabloid news from a to z . ' '
a series of recent acquisitions made it the dominant magazine publisher in quebec .
after a recent merger , it is also the only province - wide distributor of magazines and newspapers in quebec .
finally , with maxwell communication , the company controls 54 % of don ##oh ##ue inc . , a quebec city pulp and paper concern .
the new , as yet unnamed , subsidiary will combine quebec ##or ' s existing printing unit and maxwell graphics .
it will have 61 plants from coast to coast and $ 1 . 5 billion in annual sales .
quebec ##or will own 57 . 5 % of the new subsidiary .
the maxwell deal is quebec ##or ' s second big printing acquisition in just over a year .
last october , quebec ##or bought 23 canadian printing plants from bce inc . , a montreal telecommunications , manufacturing , energy and real estate company .
that purchase doubled quebec ##or ' s annual printing revenue to $ 750 million .
in london trading yesterday , maxwell communication shares rose nine pen ##ce , to 216 pen ##ce - l ##rb - $ 3 . 41 - rr ##b - .

the u . s . equal employment opportunity commission sued new york state for age discrimination against appointed state judges .
the suit , filed in federal court in manhattan , charges that new york ' s mandatory retirement age of 76 violate ##s federal law .
separately , the commission intervened in a connecticut state judge ' s age - bias suit in federal court in new haven .
the commission ' s filing in that case challenges connecticut ' s mandatory retirement age of 70 for appointed judges .
` ` the issue is n ' t age - - age is just a number .
the issue is one of a judge ' s experience , his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench , ' ' justice rubin said .
` ` i ' ve had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities . ' '
the suit ' s impact on new york may be narrow , however .
under new york law , elected judges must retire at age 70 , but then can be appointed to two - year terms until they reach 76 .
a spoke ##sw ##oman for the state ' s office of court administration declined to comment on the suit .
but she said the state currently has 35 appointed judges who are over 70 .
in connecticut , however , most state judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the state legislature .
the parties in the connecticut case have agreed to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another ee ##oc age - bias case against vermont .
aaron men ##t , connecticut ' s chief court administrator , declined to comment on the suit and the ee ##oc ' s intervention .
organized crime strike forces likely to be abolished next month .
the units are autonomous from u . s . attorneys ' offices and focus exclusively on prose ##cuting organized - crime cases .
in february , mr . thorn ##burgh announced his plan to ab ##olis ##h the units .
he says the strike - force lawyers will work more efficiently under the supervision of u . s . attorneys .
the bill is expected to pass in congress next month .
congress temporarily halted mr . thorn ##burgh ' s effort with an app ##ropriation resolution that prohibited him from using budget ##ed funds to implement his plan .
they predict that organized - crime activity will increase once the units are dissolved and their responsibilities transferred to u . s . attorneys ' offices .
some former strike - force personnel say the units have already begun to break up .
` ` those who have left have expressed an opinion that the strike force should continue , ' ' ms . br ##eve ##tti says .
but mr . run ##kel contend ##s there has been no exodus of strike - force lawyers .
he says 27 lawyers have left and 21 have been hired since mr . thorn ##burgh announced his plan .
at the time the plan was announced , there were 135 lawyers .
some congressional leaders intend to continue to fight for independent strike forces .
among other things , the bill calls for a reorganization of the justice department .
the senate is expected to consider the bill shortly , says the senator ' s spokesman .
mr . run ##kel says he doubts mr . kennedy can muster enough congressional support to re ##org ##ani ##ze the justice department .

d ##pc said it could n ' t comment on the suit .
the investment community , however , strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either boeing or its work force .
and the company is certain to get out some aircraft with just supervisors and other non - striking employees on hand .
that included 21 of the company ' s 747 - 400 ju ##mbo jets , its most successful product .
` ` it ' s not a pretty picture , ' ' said david smith , an analyst with raymond james & associates .
` ` but it would just mean a great first and second quarter next year . ' '
phillip bran ##non of merrill lynch capital markets added : ` ` you do n ' t want to minimize this and say nobody is looking at it .
but the strike has n ' t gone on long enough for boeing to lose business in any real sense . ' '

suppliers and sub ##con ##tra ##ctors are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules .
and , of course , there ' s the un ##stead ##y labor situation .
also , a contract with the united auto workers at the company ' s helicopter plant in philadelphia expired oct . 15 .
this contract , covering about 3 , 000 hourly production and maintenance workers , is being extended on a day - to - day basis .
on top of that , boeing would make cost - of - living adjustments projected to be 5 % for each year of the contract .
the union , though , has called the offer ` ` insulting . ' '
the company reiterated yesterday that it ' s willing to rec ##on ##fi ##gur ##e the package , but not add to the substance of it .
sales soared 28 % to $ 15 . 43 billion from $ 12 . 09 billion .
the settlement relates to four contracts negotiated from 1982 to 1985 , prosecutors said .
a boeing spokesman responded : ` ` all along the company has said there was no grounds for criminal prosecution .
that was borne out by the justice department ' s decision ' ' to settle the case .
foothills ' main rival to build a mackenzie delta pipeline is likely to be trans ##cana ##da pipeline ##s .
` ` neither is going to back down easily . ' '
trans ##cana ##da declined to comment on the foothills application .
a number of issues still need to be resolved before canadian regulators give any project the final go - ahead .
first , the price of natural gas will have to almost double .
but foothills said it plans to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line , the alaska natural gas transportation system further north toward alaska .
if that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators , foothills said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting mackenzie delta reserves to the alaska mainline .
it ' s also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would - be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects .
few petitions , however , have actually delayed or sc ##ut ##tled mergers .

first union , with assets of about $ 32 billion , said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory authorities .
the company has already missed its initial oct . 1 target date for completing the merger .

the consultants had been working to finish a report this week .
the committee intends to meet next week to make a recommendation on the new plan .
texas air has run into difficulty res ##elling about $ 20 million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market , the person said .
and plans to raise another $ 20 million through changes to an insurance policy have hit a s ##na ##g , the source said .
an eastern spokesman said ` ` the $ 40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of eastern ' s plan .
forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant . ' '
it is unclear what caused the creditors to do an about - face on exploring alternatives to eastern ' s new reorganization plan .
however , since eastern first filed for chapter 11 protection march 9 , it has consistently promised to pay creditors 100 cents on the dollar .
ernst & young said eastern ' s plan would miss projections by $ 100 million .
goldman said eastern would miss the same mark by at least $ 120 million .
the consultants maintained eastern would n ' t generate the cash it needs and would have to issue new debt to meet its targets under the plan .
eastern at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts ' report ` ` completely off base . ' '
he said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on eastern ' s reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating .
` ` in every case , people would like to see a consent ##ual plan , ' ' he said .
eastern eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk , its south american routes , which were valued at $ 400 million .
such a change meant the reorganization plan the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid , and the two sides had to begin negotiating again .

call from sept . 30 , 1993 , at 100 3 \ / 16 , declining by 1 \ / 16 point a year to to par .
the move comes a week after par ##iba ##s announced that it was preparing to bid for 66 . 7 % control of navigation mix ##te .
that would be a blow to both par ##iba ##s and navigation mix ##te .

` ` we are still looking , ' ' said a deutsche bank spokesman .
all ##ian ##z said in its statement that it was acting to protect that interest , which ties it to navigation mix ##te as a partner .
all ##ian ##z ' s statement stressed the company ' s previously announced position that par ##iba ##s ' s offer price is too low .
the problem here , analysts say , is that if par ##iba ##s wins its 66 . 7 % , remaining navigation mix ##te shares will fall in value .
the all ##ian ##z statement led to speculation that all ##ian ##z eventually could sell to par ##iba ##s .
that would be bad news for navigation mix ##te ' s current management , which was counting on all ##ian ##z to help fen ##d off par ##iba ##s .
all ##ian ##z did n ' t say whom , if anyone , it will support .
par ##iba ##s currently intends to offer 1 , 850 francs a share for navigation mix ##te shares that receive full divide ##nds this year .

according to one london - based analyst , even higher interest rates wo n ' t help the pound if britain ' s government continues to appear unstable .
one u . s . trader , however , dismissed sterling doom ##say ##ers while acknowledging there is little immediate upside potential for the u . k . unit .
` ` there is no question that the situation is bad , but we may be painting a gloom ##ier picture than we should , ' ' he said .

japanese companies have long been accused of sac ##ri ##fi ##cing profit to boost sales .
but fuji ##tsu ltd . has taken that practice to a new extreme .
its bid : one yen , or less than a u . s . penny .
the bid created such a fur ##or that fuji ##tsu said it is now offering to withdraw from the project .
` ` from a common - sense viewpoint , it was not socially acceptable , ' ' a fuji ##tsu spoke ##sw ##oman said yesterday .
hiroshima city officials could n ' t be reached to find out whether they would drop fuji ##tsu ' s bid .
fuji ##tsu said it issued the low bid because it wanted a foot in the door of a potentially lucrative market .
` ` we desperately wanted the contract because we want experience in the field , ' ' the fuji ##tsu spoke ##sw ##oman said .
` ` we expect a big market in the future , so in the long term it will be profitable .
it ' s a kind of an investment . ' '
indeed , fuji ##tsu officials admitted they may have been a little over ##ze ##alo ##us .
` ` it ' s contrary to common sense , ' ' she added .
specifically , fuji ##tsu won the right to design the specifications for a computer ##ized system that will show water lines throughout the city .

japanese local governments are expected to invest heavily in computer systems over the next few years , and many companies expect that field to provide substantial revenue .
` ` we can expect a hundreds - of - billions - of - yen market . ' '

executives at ne ##ko ##osa could n ' t be reached , and officials at georgia pacific declined to comment .
analysts , however , were surprised because the tender offer appeared un ##sol ##ici ##ted .
` ` it ' s quite a bombs ##hell , ' ' said one , adding that the offer could spark a period of industry consolidation .
ne ##ko ##osa closed yesterday at $ 42 . 75 , up $ 2 . 75 , in new york stock exchange composite trading .

international paper or we ##yer ##hae ##user could step in . ' '

for the sixth time in as many years , continental airlines has a new senior executive .
gone is d . joseph co ##rr , the airline ' s chairman , chief executive and president , appointed only last december .
mr . co ##rr resigned to pursue other business interests , the airline said .
succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be frank lorenzo , chairman and chief executive of continental ' s parent , texas air corp .
mr . lorenzo , 49 years old , is reclaim ##ing the job that was his before mr . co ##rr signed on .
the airline also named mickey fore ##t as president .
mr . fore ##t , 44 , is a 15 - year veteran of texas air and texas international airlines , its predecessor .
most recently he had been executive vice president for planning and finance at texas air .
top executives at continental have n ' t lasted long , especially those recruited from outside .
but mr . co ##rr ' s tenure was shorter than most .
before that , he was an executive with a manufacturing concern .
at continental he cut money - losing operations , which helped produce a modest profit in this year ' s second quarter .
continental is texas air ' s flagship and was built painfully to its present size under mr . lorenzo after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in 1986 .
mr . fore ##t is one of a handful of executives mr . lorenzo has relied on over the years .
previously , he had served in financial planning positions at the company ' s eastern airlines unit .
another longtime ally , phil ba ##kes , currently heads eastern , now in chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings .
mr . ba ##kes previously had a turn at running continental .

one could imagine such a lu ##ll in the lives of the arabs before the quad ##rup ##ling of oil prices .

these farmers may have a grip on the world ' s very heart .
ever since the link to cho ##les ##terol was disclosed , americans have begun scarf ##ing up ps ##yl ##lium in their breakfast cereal ##s .
` ` the proper climatic conditions do n ' t exist in many places in the world . ' '
only one thing is certain here : p ##ys ##lli ##um is likely to remain solely an export item from sid ##hp ##ur for a long time .
local farmers say it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fen ##ug ##ree ##k , a leg ##ume .
as such , the soluble fiber has an almost fan ##atic following in northern india .
a prominent businessman in bombay gives a similar test ##imo ##nia ##l : ` ` i have been taking it daily since 1961 .
' ' folk doctors also pre ##scribe it for kidney , bladder and ur ##eth ##ra problems , duo ##den ##al ul ##cer ##s and hem ##or ##rh ##oids .
the plant has a hairy stem that produces flowers and dim ##in ##utive seeds .
the trans ##lus ##cent hu ##sk of the seed is removed , si ##fted and crushed ; the seed itself is fed to animals .
some 90 % of the crop , which was worth $ 26 million last year , is exported .
but some time ago , researchers discovered that soluble fibers also lower cho ##les ##terol levels in the blood .
cincinnati - based p & g took an interest ; it ordered two studies on ps ##yl ##lium and cho ##les ##terol .
one of the studies , done at the university of minnesota , tested 75 people with raised cho ##les ##terol levels .
in april , the ps ##yl ##lium band ##wa ##gon got more crowded .
in september , kellogg co . launched a competing ps ##yl ##lium - fortified cereal called heart ##wise .
suddenly , on television , in advertisements and on their cereal boxes , americans were in ##unda ##ted with news about the obscure seed .
the flood of claims and counter - claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereal ##s .
this month , the food and drug administration expressed concern that americans might someday , in various forms , ing ##est too much ps ##yl ##lium .
currently , there is a lu ##ll in the ps ##yl ##lium war .
the fda has asked kellogg and general mills to show research that their cereal ##s are safe .
it also ordered p & g to produce more studies to butt ##ress its claims that meta ##mu ##ci ##l can lower cho ##les ##terol .
but the agency has n ' t yanked ps ##yl ##lium off store shelves .
if the fda approve ##s the new uses of ps ##yl ##lium , other companies are expected to rush to market with ps ##yl ##lium products .
` ` it ' s going to be a sensation ##al thing , ' ' says mr . krishna ##mur ##thy of p & g in bombay .
says ps ##yl ##lium export ##er mr . patel : ` ` i just got back yesterday from the u . s . .
in the newspapers , on the radio and tv , ps ##yl ##lium is everywhere . ' '
but the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers .
you get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined . ' '
even at the basic chemicals , pharmaceuticals and cosmetics export promotion council , the government agency that promotes the seed , the ps ##yl ##lium boom is distant thunder .
in one way , the ps ##yl ##lium middle ##men - - the buyers and export ##ers - - are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves .
they want ps ##yl ##lium prices low for their purchases next year .
sid ##hp ##ur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where ps ##yl ##lium is grown in large quantities .
this is partly due to the particular demands of the crop .
ps ##yl ##lium needs sandy soil , dew during the first few weeks , and then total dry ##ness when its seeds are mat ##uring .
big buyers like pro ##cter & gamble say there are other spots on the globe , and in india , where the seed could be grown .
` ` it ' s not a crop that ca n ' t be doubled or triple ##d , ' ' says mr . krishna ##mur ##thy .
but no one has made a serious effort to transplant the crop .
in sid ##hp ##ur , it is almost time to so ##w this year ' s crop .
` ` maybe i ' ll plant cast ##or - oil seeds . ' '
his brother , park ##ha ##ji , whose head is swat ##hed in a gorgeous crimson tu ##rba ##n , nods vigorous assent .

small businesses say a recent trend is like a dream come true : more - affordable rates for employee - health insurance , initially at least .
the reasonable first - year rates can be followed by increases of 60 % or more if a covered employee files a major claim , they complain .
for employee and employer alike , the worry is widespread .
surveys repeatedly show that small - business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns .
some law ##makers may seek legislation to limit overly restrictive insurance policies .
the concern grows out of increased efforts by the ins ##urer ##s to woo the small - business market .
` ` one case of cancer or a high - risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up 40 % to 60 % .
small - business people end up paying insurance premium ##s worth two to three times the cost of one illness . ' '
but it says that rapid rate increases are directly tied to the soaring cost of health care .
some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market .
they say insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do .

rep . wax ##man and democratic sen . edward kennedy of massachusetts have proposed regulation to deal with the problem .
such requirements , they argue , make it difficult to provide a basic , low - cost health - benefits package .

the complex ##ities of the insurance problem make the outcome difficult to predict .
but to ms . allen , the employee whose back problem triggered a huge insurance - rate increase , the issue was simple .

in the aftermath of the beijing massacre on june 4 , economists advanced wildly diver ##gent views on how hong kong would be affected .
among the most upbeat was bt broker ##age - l ##rb - asia - rr ##b - ltd .
in a june 5 reaction , the bankers trust co . unit proclaimed the economy ` ` shock ##proof . ' '
today , with business activity in hong kong staggering along at an uneven pace , the economy itself seems locked in a struggle between hope and fear .
manufacturers have survived the turmoil in china largely un ##sca ##thed .
signs of revival seem evident in hong kong ' s hard - hit hotel sector .
but in the stock and real - estate markets , activity remains spot ##ty even though prices have regained much of their lost ground .
wan ##ing demand reported by import ##ers , retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community that is sharply tightening its belt .
that paradox is hong kong ' s economically reward ##ing yet politically per ##ilo ##us relationship with china .
as a model of capitalist efficiency on southern china ' s doorstep , hong kong ' s prospects look good .
china ' s land and labor offer inexpensive alternatives to local industry .
china - bound freight streams through the territory ' s port .
these benefits seem secure despite china ' s current economic and political troubles .
but to hong kong , china is n ' t purely business .
it is also the sovereign power that , come 1997 , will take over this british colony .
china ' s leaders have promised generous liberties for post - 1997 hong kong .
that promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on marxist dog ##ma and brute force to crush their nation ' s democracy movement .
out ##flow ##s of people and capital from hong kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s .
with interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since june 4 , that assumption no longer seems so safe .
investment and emigration plans take time to come to fruit ##ion .
only four months have passed since the beijing massacre , and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact .
the only consensus is that more money and people may leave hong kong than had been thought likely .
this expected blow has cast a pal ##l over the economy ' s prospects .
the question , as many people see it , is how long such uncertainty will last .
it may experience an ups ##wing or two in between .
` ` investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slow ##down in economic activity in the run ##up to 1997 , ' ' she says .
` ` over the next few years , i would advise caution . ' '
such a pace of growth , though respectable for mature industrial ##ized economies , would be unusually slow for hong kong .
only twice since the 1960s has annual gross domestic product growth here fallen below 5 % for two or more consecutive years .
the first instance occurred in 1967 - 68 , when china ' s cultural revolution triggered bloody street riot ##ing in the colony .
the other came in 1974 - 75 from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash .
during the past 10 years , hong kong ' s economic growth has averaged 8 . 3 % annually .
under the current circumstances , he says , their scenario no longer seems un ##real ##istic .
` ` the city could lose some of its entrepreneur ##ial flavor .
it does n ' t have to be a disaster .
it just means that hong kong would become a less exciting place . ' '
after taking into account the fallout from the china crisis , the government has projected 1989 gdp growth of 5 % .
the updated forecast , published aug . 25 , compares with an earlier forecast of 6 % published march 1 and a 7 . 4 % rate achieved in
sir piers jacobs , hong kong ' s financial secretary , says a further downward revision may be justified unless the economy stages a more convincing rally .
` ` we are n ' t looking at anything like a doom ##sd ##ay scenario , ' ' he says .
` ` but clearly we ' re entering a difficult period . ' '
many factors besides a dread of 1997 will have a bearing on hong kong ' s economy .
barely visible on hong kong ' s property scene in 1985 , by last year japan had become the top foreign investor , spending $ 60 ##2 million .
the market has grown relatively quiet since the china crisis .
but if the japanese return in force , their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors ' wan ##ing commitment .
another - - and critical - - factor is the u . s . , hong kong ' s biggest export market .
even before the china crisis , weak u . s . demand was slowing local economic growth .
conversely , strong consumer spending in the u . s . two years ago helped prop ##el the local economy at more than twice its current rate .
indeed , a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern hong kong ' s economic rhythm .
but economic arguments , however solid , wo n ' t necessarily impress hong kong ' s 5 . 7 million people .
many are refugees , having fled china ' s une ##nding cycles of political repression and poverty since the communist party took power in 1949 .
emigration applications soared in 1985 , when britain and china ratified their accord on hong kong ' s future .
in 1987 , hong kong ' s most prosperous year for a decade , 30 , 000 left , up 58 % from the previous year .
a large number of those leaving are managers and professionals .
` ` they will do it every chance they get , ' ' said one program - trading executive .
consequently , abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon , they say .
` ` more customers may come to us now , ' ' said james ca ##yne , president of bear ste ##arns co ##s .
executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the 1987 crash .
they noted that studies completed after the 1987 crash ex ##one ##rated program trading as a source of vol ##ati ##lity .
a bankers trust spokesman said that the company ' s investment arm uses stock - index ar ##bit ##rage to enhance investors ' returns .
many money managers who trade stock actively have trouble consistently matching the s & p - 500 ' s returns .
mr . gr ##auer said $ 2 billion of that is used in active index ar ##bit ##rage .
the 190 - point plunge in the stock market oct . 13 has heightened concerns about vol ##ati ##lity .
the wall street firms ' pull ##back followed their recent black ##list ##ing by several institutional investors .
phoenix mutual life insurance co . and founders asset management inc . also cut off broker ##age firms that engage in program trading .
morgan stanley has consistently been one of the top stock - index ar ##bit ##rage traders in recent months .
` ` we have to clear up these issues and find out what is present that is creating artificial vol ##ati ##lity , ' ' mr . fisher said .
` ` there is no question that investor confidence - l ##rb - in the stock market - rr ##b - is critical . ' '
separately , mr . ca ##yne of bear ste ##arns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to ` ` enhance stabilization . ' '
margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security .
current rules permit investors to put up less cash for futures than for stocks .
some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for vol ##ati ##lity .
these rules , they say , permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks , which frequently knocks the two markets out of line .
` ` there has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis , ' ' said christopher pedersen , director of trading at twenty - first securities corp .
` ` one agency should have the authority over all equity products .
the former comes from the latest wave of political activism in hollywood , especially around feminist issues such as abortion .
put these together , and you get programs about rape .
obviously , it ' s harder to establish a sense of place in a one - shot tv movie .
this tale of a chicago police ##woman returning home to find the man who raped her 20 years earlier is supposed to be set in the oz ##ark ##s .
he quotes one student saying , ` ` you ' re just the kind of jew ##boy we southern ##ers ca n ' t stand .
not to judge by ` ` settle the score , ' ' in which mr . so ##hm ##er seems to be settling a score of his own .
but in mr . so ##hm ##er ' s oz ##ark ##s , he is but the tip of the patriarch ##al ice ##berg .
every man kate encounters is either s ##nig ##ger ##ingly pu ##ritan ##ical , vicious ##ly patron ##izing , revolt ##ingly le ##cher ##ous , or all three .
he ' s the director of the local planned parent ##hood chapter .
as for the women , they ' re pathetic .
kate ' s ma - l ##rb - louise latham - rr ##b - is a moral coward .
at the very least , it would appear that sis is a poor judge of masculine charm .
at this point , the truce between feminism and sensation ##alis ##m gets mighty uneasy .
take the scene in which kate stands naked by a lighted window , whispering to her hidden ass ##ail ##ant , ` ` look all you want .
with friends like mr . so ##hm ##er , do the feminist ##s of hollywood need enemies ?
he added that final guidelines to be published in early november will determine whether the bank is in compliance .
cross ##land said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan .
a major factor in the third - quarter loss was the write - down of $ 143 . 6 million of goodwill .
cross ##land recorded an additional $ 20 million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter .
net interest income for the third quarter declined to $ 35 . 6 million from $ 70 . 1 million a year ago .
however , non - interest income rose to $ 23 . 5 million from $ 22 million .
third - quarter loan origin ##ations dropped sharply to $ 66 ##3 million from $ 1 billion a year ago .
about $ 51 ##8 million of debt is affected .
open it and two soul ##ful eyes on a boy ' s brown face peer out from the page , pleading ##ly .
does the ty ##ke have a good mind about to be wasted ?
is he a victim of gram ##m - ru ##dman cuts ?
no , but he ' s endangered all the same : his new sitcom on abc needs a following to stay on the air .
abc has n ' t had much luck with shows featuring blacks in recent years , and the producers of one new arrival are a bit desperate .
so producers al ##yce and top ##per care ##w spun their ro ##lo ##de ##xes and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct - mail campaign .
by woo ##ing a core black audience they figure they might keep the show alive at least until the spring semester .
using direct mail for a tv show is like fishing for whale with a bread ##ed hook .
but employing this kind of gut - wren ##ching plea to black consciousness makes it even more unusual .
` ` this is a very personal , ethnic style , ' ' mr . care ##w says . ` `
i want people in the barber shops and the beauty shops and standing in line at the rib joints to be talking about the show .
i want white america to talk about it , too , but i ' m convinced that the grape ##vine is what ' s happening . ' '
abc says it is aware of the producers ' action , but the mail ##ing was sent without the network ' s blessing .
the letter , in fact , takes a ja ##b at abc for being a la ##gga ##rd in black programming .
some shows just do n ' t impress , he says , and this is one of them .
it ' s a matter of being close to those suppliers ; many of those companies do n ' t know us as well as they should . ' '
trans ##cana ##da transports all gas that moves eastward from alberta .
that includes all the gas consumed in ontario and quebec , along with the bulk of canadian gas exports to the
` ` having more than a token presence here should enhance communications and business relationships , ' ' mr . lit ##vin ##chuk said . ` `
since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers ' ability to sell it , it helps to have input and access to transportation companies . ' '
all 700 toronto - based employees will be offered positions in calgary , the company said .
trans ##cana ##da is 49 . 1 % owned by montreal - based holding company bce inc .
but with sales growth slug ##gis ##h and other men ' s stores putting on the heat , the venerable retailer can no longer afford such a smug attitude .
one color photo displays a rainbow of dress shirts tied in a knot ; another picture shows neck ##ties with bold designs .
the message is loud and clear : this is not your father ' s brooks brothers .
one ad shows a bright red jacket paired with a black leather skirt .
brooks brothers hopes that shaking its time - honored traditions will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise .
we want them to buy more of their wardrobe here . ' '
industry watch ##ers agree that brooks brothers is long over ##due in up ##dating its button ##ed - down image , which has stunt ##ed its growth .
mr . robert ##i con ##cede ##s that since the $ 750 million takeover , ` ` sales growth has n ' t been dramatic . ' '
as brooks brothers jumps into the fashion fray , it will be playing catch up .
many cloth ##iers , especially ralph lauren , have cash ##ed in on the recent popularity of updated ivy league and english styles .
in keeping with men ' s broader fashion scope today , businessmen are da ##bbling in english and italian suits that are conservative but not st ##od ##gy .
the rigid ivy league customer , brooks brothers ' bread and butter , meanwhile is becoming extinct .
thus , brooks brothers has lost customers to stores that offer more variety such as paul stuart , barney ##s new york and louis , boston .
by making a break from tradition , brooks brothers is seeking a delicate balance .
brooks brothers ' aim is for 20 % of total sales to come from the women ' s department , up from the current 12 % .
` ` everybody forget ##s that there are fashion cycles in classic merchandise , ' ' observes carol farmer , a retail consultant .
` ` for women , dressing for success in a real structured way is over . ' '
despite these challenges , marks & spencer sees big potential in brooks brothers , noting the widely recognized name and global presence .
marks & spencer plans to open roughly 18 more u . s . stores in the next five years .
brooks brothers says business is robust at its 30 outlets in japan and two shops in hong kong .
marks & spencer is also considering opening stores across europe sometime in the future .
brooks brothers is also re ##mo ##del ##ing its stores .
wednesday , it will un ##ve ##il a $ 7 million ref ##ur ##bis ##hing at its flagship store on madison avenue .
with newly installed es ##cala ##tors , the store retains its signature wood - and - brass look but is less intimidating .
because the biggest growth in men ##sw ##ear is in casual sports ##wear , brooks brothers is chasing more of that business .
but it now offers more two - button versions and suits with a tape ##red fit .
it also plans to add suits cut for athletic men with broader upper bodies .
next spring , nearly 30 % of its suits will have plea ##ted pants , compared with virtually none a couple of years ago .
says mr . robert ##i : ` ` we want to turn the customer on .
fe ##rro corp . said it will buy back as many as one million common shares .
the maker of chemical and industrial materials did n ' t say how much it would pay or when it would make the transactions .
fe ##rro also said it would cancel the unused portion of a 1987 buy - back plan for administrative reasons .
the plan calls for the company to buy back 2 , 250 , 000 shares , which reflects a 3 - for - 2 stock split this year .
so far the company had bought back 1 . 6 million shares .
in new york stock exchange composite trading friday , fe ##rro closed at $ 25 . 25 , down 50 cents .
arthur price abruptly quit as president and chief executive officer of mt ##m entertainment inc . , a los angeles production company that has fallen on hard times .
a tv ##s spokesman said he did n ' t know mr . price ' s plans .
industry analysts speculated that mr . price ' s sudden departure may have stemmed from conflicts with mr . ga ##t ##ward .
mr . ga ##t ##ward declined to comment , and mr . price could n ' t be reached on friday .
at the time , mr . ga ##t ##ward said his friendship with mr . price had smoothed the way for its link with the small british company .
but tv ##s stunned industry analysts last month by disc ##los ##ing that it expected mt ##m to post an operating loss for this year .
in that announcement , tv ##s also said it was trim ##ming production finance and hiring a new u . s . sales manager .
further staff cuts are likely , the spokesman indicated .

tv ##s blame ##s difficulties in pe ##ddling re ##run ##s of mt ##m shows to u . s . broadcasters for the problems at mt ##m .

mr . tin ##ker later left to become chairman of national broadcasting co .

two rival bid ##ders for con ##na ##ught bio ##sc ##ience ##s extended their offers to acquire the toronto - based vaccine manufacturer friday .

both offers are conditional on regulatory approval ##s and enough shares being tender ##ed to give the bid ##ders a majority of con ##na ##ught ' s shares outstanding .
at the close of business thursday , ci ##ba - ge ##ig ##y and chi ##ron said 11 , 580 common shares had been tender ##ed to their offer .
at last report , con ##na ##ught had 21 . 8 million shares outstanding .

when the economy stumbled in the mid - 1970s , ak ##zo n ##v fell out of bed .
it was n ' t until the early 1980s that ak ##zo nurse ##d itself back to health .
now , as a new down ##turn in the chemical industry lo ##oms , ak ##zo says it is in far better shape to cope .
during the same period , the company has sold about 1 . 6 billion guild ##ers of assets .
the fibers business , whose products go into textiles , carpet ##ing and myriad industrial uses , now accounts for only 20 % of ak ##zo ' s sales .
` ` we have definitely become less cyclic ##al , ' ' sy ##b berg ##sma , executive vice president - finance , said in an interview .
but he said ak ##zo is considering ` ` alliances ' ' with american drug companies , although he would n ' t elaborate .
an indication of ak ##zo ' s success in res ##ha ##ping itself will come thursday when it reports third - quarter results .
analysts expect the company to show profit of about 225 million guild ##ers , up 9 % from 206 . 3 million guild ##ers a year earlier .
a bigger test will come next year if , as many analysts expect , bulk chemical prices slump in europe .
he figures ak ##zo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year .
for example , ak ##zo has only minor pet ##ro ##chemical operations , is small in plastics and does n ' t make fe ##rti ##lizer ##s .
the company is exposed to bulk chemicals , however .
although bulk - chemical prices have begun falling in the u . s . , they are generally stable in europe , mr . berg ##sma said .
ak ##zo ' s biggest move in this area was the 1987 acquisition of st ##au ##ffer chemical co . ' s specialty chemical business for $ 625 million .
ak ##zo also makes products derived from salt , such as ch ##lor ##ine and ca ##ust ##ic soda .
in the fibers division , profit remains weak , largely because of persistent over ##cap ##ac ##ity .
but ak ##zo is still slim ##ming down : it recently announced plans to eliminate about 1 , 700 fiber - related jobs in the netherlands and west germany .
mr . berg ##sma said world - wide industry sales of ara ##mi ##d fibers are expected to total about $ 500 million this year .
sales growth of 10 % a year seems possible , he said , and ak ##zo expects its t ##war ##on business to become profitable in 1990 .
ak ##zo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in paints , auto finishes and industrial coating ##s .
mr . berg ##sma said ak ##zo is likely to see strong profit growth from coating ##s as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale .
for ak ##zo ' s drug business , where profits have shown lit ##le change for the past five years , mr . berg ##sma predicted moderate profit growth .
mr . berg ##sma said ak ##zo hopes to have approval to sell its marvel ##on pill in the u . s . in 1992 .
ak ##zo also has small operations in diagnostic tests , generic drugs and veterinary products .
veterinary products are showing especially strong growth , mr . berg ##sma said .
among the leading products is a flu shot for horses .
we ' re sorry to see nigel lawson ' s departure from the british government .
the early om ##ens , we admit , scarcely suggest so whole ##some an outcome .
the fleet street reaction was captured in the guardian headline , ` ` departure reveals thatcher poison . ' '
british politicians divide into two groups of chickens , those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling .
the problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates , conservative , free - market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps .
there are the supply - side global ##ists , who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates .
and there are the twin - deficit keynes ##ians , who predict \ / advocate dev ##al ##uation ##s to balance trade flows .
in the british case , mr . lawson is the closest thing in london to a supply - side global ##ist .
they increased the after - tax rate of return and made britain a far more attractive place to invest , producing sudden capital in ##flow ##s .
by accounting definitions , this had to produce a sudden trade deficit .
to push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit , a policy britain has repeatedly proved disastrous .
but this devastated the u . s . manufacturing sector , laying the seeds of protection ##ism .
mr . lawson , though not allowed to join the ems , chose to ` ` shadow ' ' the deutsche mark .
he re ##ape ##d inflation along with rapid growth , no doubt valid ##ating sir alan ' s predictions in the prime minister ' s mind .
so the british experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of albion .
to begin with , we should note that in contrast to the u . s . deficit , britain has been running la ##rg ##ish budget surplus ##es .
in pursuit of this mystery , keynes ##ian adept ##s and twin - deficit ma ##ven ##s need not apply .
we should also add mr . lawson ' s own explanation , as we understand it .
unlike the u . s . , britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages .
the wage stick ##iness , which o ##ec ##d studies confirm is particularly high in britain , gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation .
inflation is easier to spark and harder to control .
nearby paul craig roberts , a distinguished supply - side ##r with mon ##eta ##rist sy ##mp ##athi ##es , argues the case for sir alan .
somewhere in between there must be a golden mean , perhaps measured by m - whatever , but perhaps measured by purchasing power par ##ity .
the global ##ists tend to think mr . lawson ran onto technical reefs .
in fixing rates the choice of initial par ##ities is crucial , for example , and perhaps he picked the wrong pound - d ##m rate .
for that matter , perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency .
we sy ##mp ##athi ##ze with mrs . thatcher ' s reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperative ##s of west germany .
perhaps the shock would have been less if they ' d fixed to another low - tax , der ##eg ##ulated , supply - side economy .
alan reynolds of poly ##con ##omics adds his suspicion that the un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed inflation ##ary cu ##lp ##rit is the budget surplus .
mr . reynolds also notes that since british banks have no reserve requirements , high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession .
we would add that in political terms , mrs . thatcher ' s problem was failing to decide between the chancellor and her adviser .
in the end , neither policy was followed , and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery .
in particular , ` ` shadow ##ing ' ' a currency is anything but fixing ; it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility .
all the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy .
better to have a true mon ##eta ##rist policy , just for the experience .
but it was the underlying situation that became into ##ler ##able .
what mr . major and mrs . thatcher will do now remains to be seen .
they confront stubborn inflation and a sa ##gging economy , that is to say , st ##ag ##fl ##ation .
this can not be solved by pro ##voking a further down ##turn ; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation .
mr . phillips made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency .
first and foremost , mr . phillips said he hopes to improve client service .
but mr . phillips recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by del ##ega ##ting much of his administrative work to a deputy .
he also plans to get to know clients that mr . roman was closer to , such as lever brothers , american express and sea ##gram .
the two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins .
mr . phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the w ##pp takeover .
industry executives and analysts are divided on whether mr . phillips is up to the task .
he is n ' t as well - known to clients as is mr . roman .
the one thing mr . phillips clearly does have going for him is continuity , although it is n ' t certain if that will be enough .
mr . phillips and mr . roman are indeed quite similar in substance , if not in style .
while mr . roman is a work ##ah ##olic details ##man , mr . phillips would rather delegate , leaving him time for his interests outside the office .
the move , budget ##ed at about $ 7 million , actually came in at about $ 10 million , he said .
but margins will be helped , too , by some other cost - saving steps .

for the year , sales were up 5 . 6 % to $ 6 . 97 billion compared with $ 6 . 61 billion in fiscal 1988 .
sales for both years reflect 12 - month performances for each year of i . mag ##nin , bullock ' s , and bullock ##s wil ##shire .
on a comparable store basis , including the new acquisitions for both years , sales for fiscal 1989 were up 1 . 9 % .
macy reported a net loss for fiscal 1989 of $ 53 . 7 million compared with a net loss of $ 188 . 2 million for fiscal 1988 .

excluding those businesses , earnings before interest , taxes and de ##pre ##ciation for 1988 would have been $ 72 ##8 . 5 million .
as of feb . 1 , 1990 , the bullock ##s wil ##shire stores will operate as i . mag ##nin stores .
altogether , macy and its subsidiaries own or lease 149 department stores and 61 specialty stores nationwide .
the company estimates its total debt at about $ 5 . 2 billion .
those chains include bloom ##ing ##dale ' s , which camp ##eau recently said it will sell .
other retail properties for sale include sa ##ks fifth avenue and marshall field , retailers now owned by b . a . t plc , the british tobacco conglomerate .

the government of president f . w . de k ##ler ##k is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions .
the result is that the un ##thi ##nka ##ble and ill ##ogical are happening .
six months ago , government approval for an an ##c rally was inc ##on ##ce ##iva ##ble .
the government may ease repression in some areas , but it still keeps a tight grip in others .
the an ##c vows to keep up pressure on the government .
` ` we can not wait on the government to make changes at its own pace , ' ' mr . sis ##ulu said .
they both called it a ` ` welcome home ' ' gathering .
nevertheless , an an ##c rally by any other name is still an an ##c rally .
the recently released leaders sat high atop a podium in one section of the stadium stands .
behind them was a huge an ##c flag and an even bigger sign that said ` ` an ##c lives , an ##c leads . ' '
next to them was the red flag of the outlawed south african communist party , which has long been an an ##c ally .

but now west ##ing ##house is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers .
and with its new venture with japan ' s mitsubishi heavy industries ltd . , announced last week , it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas .
for the first time since the mid - 1970s , west ##ing ##house this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants .
most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities , and west ##ing ##house believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years .
analysts agree , predicting that the revived market could significantly boost west ##ing ##house ' s bottom line in coming years .
the company expects a need for 140 , 000 mega ##wat ##ts of new generation in the u . s . over the next decade .
west ##ing ##house ' s own role as a supplier also is changing .
in the past , the company usually took token equity positions in power plants it supplied as a ` ` kicker ' ' to close deals .
west ##ing ##house also jointly will bid on projects with mis ##ub ##ish ##i , giving it an edge in developing asian markets .
the west ##ing ##house - mitsubishi venture was designed as a non - equity transaction , ci ##rc ##um ##venting any possible anti ##trust concerns .
west ##ing ##house carefully crafted the agreement because the justice department earlier this year successfully challenged a proposed steam turbine joint venture with as ##ea brown bo ##ver ##i .
west ##ing ##house expects about half of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for at least the next six years .
even if that scenario occurs , west ##ing ##house figures it is prepared .
` ` once we see an order , we expect it ' ll be on line by 2000 .
a ` ` three ' ' is 10 times 10 again , and so on .
that put the ` ` seven ' ' of oct . 17 in perspective for me .

in fact , managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive variable than ever before .
however , for many , managing speed does not come naturally .
` ` but in the real world , you learn that speed and quality are not a trade - off .
speed is a component of quality - - one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers . ' '
companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations .
one team at the federal express ground operations station in nat ##ick , mass . , focused on a particularly time - sensitive operation : the morning package sort .
every morning , tractor - trailer trucks arrive at the nat ##ick ground station from boston ' s logan airport , carrying the day ' s package load .
in peak periods that load may include 4 , 000 pieces .
the packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery , so courier ##s can be on the road by 8 : 35 .
no customer is present at the morning package sort , but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction .
` ` the sooner our vans hit the road each morning , the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation . ' '
` ` we suspected there was down ##time built into our process .
but we did n ' t know just where it was until we completed our data gathering , ' ' mr . mortimer says .
` ` we used the data to redesign our sorting system and put our resources where they could do the most good . ' '
the team even created a points system to identify those courier ##s and subgroup ##s that were doing the most to reduce package - sort cycle time .
winners of the friendly competition earn a steak dinner out with their spouse ##s .
` ` the vans leave at least 15 minutes earlier , on average , than they used to .
and service levels have increased to the point where they ' re consistently above 99 % . ' '
` ` first , they produced a flow ##cha ##rt detailing the process by which an air - separation plant actually gets built .
then they identified s ##na ##gs in the process . ' '
the team then proposed modifications in their work process to management .
` ` the streamlined manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways , ' ' mr . west ##end ##orf concludes .
second , we trimmed more than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product . ' '
the team was composed of representatives from engineering , manufacturing , corporate est ##imating , flight test , material , quality control , and other departments .
the team trimmed more than two months from the cycle time previously required to develop comparable proposals .
` ` the team eliminated the crisis mental ##ity that proposal deadline ##s can generate .
the result was a more thoughtful , complete and competitive proposal , ' ' mr . anton concludes .
the successes achieved at federal express , union car ##bid ##e and gr ##um ##man suggest that managing speed may be an under ##uti ##lized source of competitive advantage .
managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction .
they effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time .
and they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work .

switzerland ' s most famous raider says he is n ' t one .
werner k . rey believes fortunes are made by being friendly .
he achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established european companies .
shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late november .
but approval is almost certain since mr . rey and a friendly adi ##a management are in control .
this will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million swiss francs and 80 million swiss francs .
` ` i like to succeed , ' ' says mr . rey during a recent morning of working at home , which he also likes .
in the corner of his reception room is a delicate antique desk piled high with dos ##sier ##s .
there is a small reno ##ir on the wall .
zurich - based magazine bi ##lan ##z lists mr . rey as having a fortune of about 1 . 5 billion swiss francs .
writes bi ##lan ##z : ` ` no one in switzerland ever came so far so fast . . .
he was simply the first in this country to realize that treasures were just lying around waiting to be picked up .
in short : rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets . ' '
but such tactics were alien to switzerland in 1976 , and still are n ' t common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain .
mr . rey made 50 million swiss francs on the sale .
` ` ball ##y was not an un ##fr ##ien ##dly takeover , ' ' he insists .
buying from willing shareholders makes an un ##fr ##ien ##dly takeover impossible , mr . rey contend ##s .
` ` i bought from willing shareholders . ' '
nevertheless , mr . rey has been very careful since then to make sure his moves are welcome .
and he has worked to shed his raider image .
in 1979 , his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the swiss metals works se ##l ##ve , based in th ##un .
with the non ##fer ##rous metals business undermine ##d in switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs , this looked like a dull undertaking .
three years later , machinery producer ate ##lier ##s de constructions me ##can ##iques de ve ##vey s . a . was to become part of the rey empire .
once again the company ' s future looked less than rosy .
but after restructuring under new management , the profits began rolling in .
they renamed it swiss can ##to ##bank and are using it to expand abroad .
in 1987 , mr . rey best ##ed leading publishing houses to take over switzerland ' s jean frey ag , a major producer of magazines and newspapers .
sul ##zer preferred him to fin ##an ##cier tito te ##tta ##man ##ti , whose secretive raid on the company ' s stock had led to a bitter battle .
for financial analysts , reading om ##ni ' s accounts is a tough challenge .
` ` companies move in and out , ' ' says he ##lga kern of k ##k swiss investment .
financial analysts note that mr . rey is attracted to companies that are under ##val ##ue ##d on the basis of their real - estate interests .
in august , om ##ni unexpectedly bought inspector ##ate ' s 80 % stake in harp ##ener ag of west germany , a land - rich company .
mr . rey says the move is yet another example of his con ##ser ##vati ##sm .
he explains that companies with real estate give ` ` security . ' '
the real estate can be used , he points out , as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development .
he says he wants to ` ` influence ' ' but not ` ` manage ' ' companies .
` ` i do n ' t want to be like - lc ##b - fin ##an ##cier alan - rc ##b - bond and the other australians .
i do n ' t want companies to be built around me as a person .

in the second step of a reorganization that began earlier this year , boeing co . said it will create a defense and space group to consolidate several divisions .
the two sides were scheduled to meet with the media ##tor this morning .
mach ##ini ##sts already have rejected a package that would provide a 10 % pay raise plus bonuses over the three - year life of the contract .
boeing has said repeatedly it wo n ' t expand its offer and the mach ##ini ##sts have responded that the offer is n ' t good enough .
however , the resolve of some of the striking 57 , 000 mach ##ini ##sts might be weakening .
about 1 , 000 strikers signed petitions last week calling for boeing and mach ##ini ##sts representatives to schedule new meetings .
the two sides had n ' t met since oct . 18 .
b . dan pin ##ick , president of boeing aerospace and electronics , will become president of the new group , which will become operational jan . 2 .
in addition , boeing said it also will re ##org ##ani ##ze all its work in wichita into military and commercial divisions .
all of the changes will reduce its overhead and stream ##line operations , boeing said .
` ` they had to do it . ' '
` ` his side of the business has been successful in a tough environment , ' ' mr . rub ##el said .
nor did it ease restrictions on exports to poland and hungary , according to u . s . officials who attended the talks .
for several years some european countries have complained that outdated coco ##m lists and restrictions served more to ham ##per their trade than to add to western security .
but u . s . officials said representatives at the meeting decided that this was ` ` a matter for further discussion at future meetings . ' '
` ` un ##is ##ys is getting cl ##ob ##bered .
just cl ##ob ##bered , ' ' said ul ##ric wei ##l , an analyst at wei ##l & associates who had once been high on the company .
` ` the quarter was terrible , and the future looks anything but encouraging . ' '
on top of that , the blue bell , pa . , concern took a $ 230 million charge related to the lay ##offs of 8 , 000 employees .
the tax payments will leave un ##is ##ys with $ 225 million in loss carry - forwards that will cut tax payments in future quarters .
the company also reported slower growth in another important business : systems that use the unix operating system .
in addition , un ##is ##ys must deal with its increasingly oppressive debt load .
debt has risen to around $ 4 billion , or about 50 % of total capital ##ization .
that means un ##is ##ys must pay about $ 100 million in interest every quarter , on top of $ 27 million in divide ##nds on preferred stock .
jim un ##ru ##h , un ##is ##ys ' s president , said he is approaching next year with caution .
he said the strength of the world - wide economy is suspect , and does n ' t see much revenue growth in the cards .
he also said that the price wars fl ##aring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year .
he said the move toward standard operating systems means customers are n ' t locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down .
but we do n ' t minimize the challenges of the near term . ' '
securities analysts were even more cautious , having been burned repeatedly on un ##is ##ys this year .
and un ##is ##ys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter .
so steve mil ##uno ##vich at first boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $ 2 a share from $ 3 .
` ` i was feeling like i was too high to begin with , ' ' he said .
` ` the break - even point for next year is much lower , but is it low enough ? ' ' he asked .
reflecting the concern , un ##is ##ys stock fell a further 75 cents to $ 16 . 25 in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange .
if a tv weather ##man gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast , donald h . st ##ras ##zh ##eim surely understands .
mr . st ##ras ##zh ##eim expects he will take some heat , and he ' s right .
since the last time he traveled this way several months ago , he has rec ##ante ##d a series of bold forecast ##s of a recession .
the firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40 % to 45 % and later to 55 % .
and , just recently , merrill lynch cut the recommended bond ##holding ##s back to 50 % .
mr . bo ##sti ##an said in august that his macro ##economic index signaled recession .
mr . shi ##lling , who was merrill lynch ' s chief economist from 1967 to 1971 , has herald ##ed a recession for months .
` ` my own personal opinion is that don threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet , ' ' he says .
now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy .
he adds , ` ` that ' s the forecast ##ing business . ' '
however risky the business , it ' s brisk these days .
but the surprisingly durable seven - year economic expansion has made min ##ce ##me ##at of more than one forecast .
this is n ' t the quiet economic science practiced in the universities .
carrying the new message on the road , mr . st ##ras ##zh ##eim meets confrontation that often occurs in inverse proportion to the size of the client .
no sophisticated professional expects economists to be right all the time .
some smaller clients do n ' t seem to notice his switch .
but with some clients , the talk can heat up a bit .
` ` i ' m one of them who hope they will , with $ 6 billion in debt on the books .
is that the forecast ? ' ' mr . o ' brien asks , trying to pin down the economist .
he does n ' t fully succeed , although mr . st ##ras ##zh ##eim lists an array of interest - rate scenarios .
or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it ' s about to be right ? ' '
it ' s all in this hand ##out you do n ' t want to look at .
we could still have a recession ' ' at some point .
one of mr . st ##ras ##zh ##eim ' s recurring themes is that the state of the economy is n ' t a simple black or white .
sometimes , like now , it ' s gray .
this somewhat - ambiguous assessment moves one alliance portfolio manager to ask : ` ` so , what is this - - a stealth recession ? ' '
another challenges merrill lynch ' s bond recommendation last year .
` ` we ' re not running that ad campaign any more , ' ' mr . st ##ras ##zh ##eim snaps in a rare show of irritation .
he adds , ` ` i think it was a fairly decent call . ' '
explaining his change of mind , mr . st ##ras ##zh ##eim says later , ` ` it ' s hard to pin this on one factor . ' '
` ` our business is constantly looking at all these things , ' ' he says .
his new forecast calls for ` ` a soft landing . ' '
mr . shi ##lling understands mr . st ##ras ##zh ##eim ' s problems .
` ` there ' s unbelievable pressure on economists to forecast these numbers , ' ' he says . ` `
you make a forecast , and then you become its prisoner . ' '
his approach to the rec ##anta ##tion is direct but low - key .
` ` for some time , we had forecast negative third - and fourth - quarter growth .

last week the british displayed unusual political im ##mat ##urity .
the chancellor of the exchequer , nigel lawson , resigned because prime minister thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser sir alan walters .
behind the silly post ##uring lies a real dispute .
mr . lawson and his european - minded colleagues want the british pound formally tied to the west german mark .
sir alan considers this an ill - advised and costly policy .
as there is an effort to ` ` anchor the dollar ' ' either to gold or other cu ##rre ##ncies , the dispute is worth examining .
until his resignation , mr . lawson had been conducting british monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark .
as a result , he reign ##ited the inflation that mrs . thatcher , through a long and costly effort , had subdued .
with inflation sur ##ging , the pound began falling against the mark .
to keep the exchange rate peg ##ged , mr . lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % .
the concept of european integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pit ##falls .
if the pound had been tied to the mark , the british would have been unable to cut their ex ##or ##bit ##ant tax rates .
when a country cuts tax rates , it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency .
it was fear of disturbing ems exchange - rate relationships that caused the chi ##rac government in france to be tim ##id about cutting tax rates .
the price of attracting capital - - whether one ' s own or that of foreigners - - is a trade deficit .
to avoid this deficit mr . lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise .
this mis ##guide ##d policy could not prevent a british trade deficit .
little wonder that mrs . thatcher ' s opponents were so anxious to keep mr . lawson in office .
it is extraordinary that the british treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by in ##fl ##ating the pound .
this change in the british capital account required an offset ##ting change in the trade account , a change that could not be prevented by peg ##ging the currency .
nigel lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of western financial circles during the 1980s .
the most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment , instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates .
this has led them in a fruit ##less and destructive policy circle .
first comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency ' s value that was pushed up by tax - rate reduction .
then , when the currency falls , interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate .
this policy is totally mind ##less , and sir alan is correct to point out its def ##iciencies .
britain and all of europe need to rec ##ons ##ider the prospects for european integration in light of the possible reunification and neutral ##ization of germany .
unless the soviet union collapses , german reunification is likely to require germany ' s neutral ##ization .

personal spending grew 0 . 2 % in september to a $ 3 . 52 ##6 trillion annual rate , the commerce department said .
it was the smallest monthly increase in a year .
at the same time , personal income was held down by the effects of hurricane hugo , which tore through parts of north and south carolina in late september .
among the economic effects of the hurricane was a sharp drop in rental income .
but the new statistics show that by september , the burst in spending seemed to be tape ##ring off .
` ` i think the consumer has pretty well played himself out , ' ' said david lit ##tman , senior economist at manufacturers national bank of detroit .
in the third quarter , the economy grew at a moderate 2 . 5 % annual rate .

during that time , control data had losses of more than $ 1 billion .
now , following asset sales that sh ##rank revenue by more than one - third this year alone , control data is flush with cash .
` ` we ' d like to continue to reduce debt , ' ' president lawrence per ##lman said .
the offer was automatically triggered by the recent sale of control data ' s imp ##rim ##is disk - drive business to sea ##gate technology inc .
he said the company has no intention of tapping its short - term bank lines ` ` for a good part of 1990 . ' '
sometime next year , control data will ` ` develop a new bank relationship , ' ' mr . per ##lman said .
loan covenant ##s require that the company achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling four - quarter profit ##ability test .
last week control data reported third - quarter earnings of $ 9 . 8 million , or 23 cents a share , on revenue of $ 76 ##3 million .
through the first nine months , the company had a loss of $ 48 ##4 million , largely reflecting the closing of its super ##com ##put ##er unit .

at the same time four of six design projects were spiked , he said .

thursday , a judge is scheduled to rule on warner ' s motion seeking to block the gu ##ber - peters duo from going to columbia .
the battery of legal documents filed in the past week in connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this hollywood dog ##fight .
the matter may never even be tried in court .
warner , which is in the process of merging with time warner inc . , says it is willing to settle the matter out of court .
so far , however , sony has n ' t been willing to meet its considerable financial demands .
mr . gu ##ber and mr . peters do n ' t have much to gain from a pro ##tracted battle .
just how ran ##cor ##ous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the two sides ' current business dealings .

mr . ra ##bino ##witz , the warner attorney , says the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract .

even white house budget director richard dar ##man had trouble finding a silver lining in the report .
the federal deficit was $ 155 . 15 billion in 1988 and $ 149 . 69 billion in 1987 .
the law sets a deficit target of $ 100 billion for fiscal 1990 .
the white house and the democratic leadership in congress blame each other for turning capital - gains taxes into such a di ##vis ##ive issue this year .
federal revenues rose 9 % to $ 99 ##0 . 79 billion .
the treasury said a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year did n ' t turn out to be quite as strong as it first appeared .
the treasury marked up its forecast by $ 17 million in july , but that proved to be about $ 5 billion too optimistic .
the government ran a deficit of $ 6 . 16 billion in september , compared with a surplus of $ 10 . 17 billion in september 1988 .
out ##lay ##s for the month totaled $ 105 . 39 billion , up from $ 87 . 57 billion a year earlier .

japanese government officials , eager to re ##bu ##t foreign criticism of japanese investments overseas , hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in japan .
polly peck ' s chairman , as ##il nad ##ir , echoed the official japanese view of the accord , which was announced friday .
but analysts say sans ##ui is a special case .
but by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of japanese companies this year , while japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies .
nor do analysts expect the sans ##ui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases .
sans ##ui was once one of japan ' s premier makers of expensive , high - quality stereo gear for audio ##phile ##s .
sans ##ui was late into the mini - component business and failed to branch into other new businesses .
as the yen soared in recent years , sans ##ui ' s deep ##ening financial problems became a vicious circle .
while competitors moved production offshore in response to the sa ##gging competitive ##ness of japanese factories , sans ##ui lacked the money to build new plants in southeast asia .
but even a japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern , some management consultants maintain .
` ` in some industries , like pharmaceuticals , acquisitions make sense . ' '
such risk taking is an everyday matter for the bra ##sh mr . nad ##ir , who is 25 % owner of polly peck as well as its chairman .
joan ##n s . lublin in london contributed to this article .
the plan still calls for lin to combine its cellular telephone properties with bells ##outh ' s and to spin off its broadcasting operations .
lin said it expects to borrow the money to pay the divide ##nd , but commitments from banks still have n ' t been obtained .
under previous terms , holders would have received a divide ##nd of only $ 20 a share .
in effect , mcc ##aw has forced lin ' s hand by bidding $ 1 . 9 billion for the stake earlier this month .
analyst estimate the value of the bells ##outh proposal at about $ 115 to $ 125 a share .
they value mcc ##aw ' s bid at $ 112 to $ 118 a share .
the previous bells ##outh pact was valued at about $ 98 to $ 110 a share .
mcc ##aw , the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the u . s . , already owns about 9 . 4 % of lin ' s stock .
over the weekend , mcc ##aw continued to call for an auction of lin .
analysts said they expect mcc ##aw to es ##cala ##te the bidding again .
` ` at some point , it will become non - economical for one company .
but i do n ' t think we ' re at that point yet . ' '
mcc ##aw ' s bid also has a similar clause .
only mcc ##aw ' s proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in june 1994 for remaining shares at third - party prices .
` ` we ' re very pleased with the new deal .
bells ##outh ' s ` ` back - end protection was flawed previously .
we think this is a superior deal to mcc ##aw ' s .
we did n ' t think a sleeping - lc ##b - bell - rc ##b - mental ##ity would be willing to take on dil ##ution . ' '
` ` how many shares will be around in 1995 ? ' ' he asked .
` ` there ' s nothing preventing bells ##outh from buying up shares in the meanwhile . ' '
bells ##outh ' s revised proposal surprised many industry analysts , especially because of the company ' s willingness to accept some dil ##ution of future earnings .
indeed , bells ##outh ' s cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable .
for 1988 , bells ##outh earned $ 1 . 7 billion , or $ 3 . 51 a share , on revenue of $ 13 . 6 billion .
in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange , bells ##outh shares fell 87 . 5 cents to $ 52 . 125 .
indeed , mcc ##aw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement .
market makers in nas ##da ##q over - the - counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading .
their motivation , however , has a strong practical aspect : program trading is hazardous to their pay ##che ##cks .
the s & p 500 is often used in ar ##bit ##rage strategies .
estimates from traders put it at less than 5 % of nas ##da ##q ' s average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares .
other market - maker grip ##es : program trading also causes the nas ##da ##q composite index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market .
because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many ot ##c stocks without sharp price moves , a condition known as ill ##iq ##uid ##ity .
some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the ot ##c market .
shear ##son lehman , however , execute ##s program trades for clients .
merrill lynch , goldman sachs and kidd ##er peabody , in addition to shear ##son , do program - trade ot ##c stocks .
shear ##son , merrill lynch and goldman sachs say they do so only for customers , however .
kidd ##er peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients ' accounts .
of course , there were sell programs in past years , too , but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days .
that ' s largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash , when individual investors fled the market and trading activity d ##wind ##led .
market makers , to cut costs , slashed inventor ##ies of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders are n ' t selling .
and to protect their reduced capital investment from er ##od ##ing further , market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress .
on days when prices are tumbling , they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will .
but this ski ##tti ##sh ##ness , mr . ant ##olin ##i says , is creating liquid ##ity problems in certain ot ##c stocks .
no one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks . ' '
but , he observes , while makers suffer losses when program trading drag ##s the market down , they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher .
` ` sometimes - lc ##b - traders - rc ##b - lose sight of that , ' ' he says .
these big stocks greatly influence the nas ##da ##q composite index .
when the computers say ` ` sell , ' ' the composite tumble ##s as well as the dow jones industrial average .
such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re - entering the market after massive sell ##offs , market makers say .

the dax dropped 19 . 69 points friday to 146 ##2 . 93 .
traders said the continued turbulence in other markets , coupled with the drop in london following the lawson resignation , were responsible .
traders said that selling pressure was n ' t enormous and that the dax dropped friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest .
they said contributing to the downward drift was the fact that many professional traders had chosen to square positions ahead of the weekend .
` ` if you take away the outside influences , the market itself looks very cheap .

when michael s . perry took the podium at a recent cosmetics industry event , more than 500 executives packing the room snapped to attention .
mr . perry , who runs un ##ile ##ver group ' s world - wide personal - care business , paused to scan the crowd .
` ` i see we have about half the audience working for us , ' ' he said , tongue in cheek .
` ` the other half , we may have before long . ' '
members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously ; their industry has been un ##sett ##led recently by acquisitions .
first un ##ile ##ver , the anglo - dutch packaged - goods giant , spent $ 2 billion to acquire brands such as faber ##ge and elizabeth arden .
it now holds the no . 3 position at u . s . department - store cosmetic counters .
then pro ##cter & gamble co . agreed to buy no ##x ##ell corp . for $ 1 . 3 billion .
for now , both companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans .
but industry watch ##ers expect them to blend the method ##ical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies .
likely changes include more emphasis on research , soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing .
but some cosmetics - industry executives wonder whether techniques hon ##ed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business .
` ` they ' re really fashion items wrapped up in little jars . ' '
both companies are conservative market ##ers that rely on extensive market research .
p & g , in particular , rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test - marketing .
consider oil of ol ##ay , which p & g acquired as part of richardson - vic ##ks international in 1985 .
the moist ##uri ##zer , introduced in 1962 , had a dow ##dy image .
p & g set out to rep ##osition the brand by broad ##ening the product line to include facial clean ##ser ##s and moist ##uri ##zers for sensitive skin .
it also redesigned oil of ol ##ay ' s packaging , stamp ##ing the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more op ##ulent look .
go ##lia ##ths like un ##ile ##ver and p & g have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals .
next year , no ##x ##ell plans to roll out a perfume called navy , says george l . bun ##ting jr . , chairman of no ##x ##ell .
packaged - goods companies ` ` will make it tough ##er for smaller people to remain competitive , ' ' mr . bun ##ting says .
rumors that un ##ile ##ver is interested in acquiring sc ##hering - pl ##ough corp . ' s maybe ##llin ##e unit are widespread .
un ##ile ##ver wo n ' t comment ; sc ##hering , however , denies the brand is for sale .
the presence of un ##ile ##ver and p & g is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics .
while the two are among the world ' s biggest ad ##vert ##iser ##s , most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads .
instead , they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases .
the most dramatic changes , however , probably will come in new - product development .
that figure has been inch ##ing up for several years .
the packaged - goods market ##ers may try filling that gap with a spat ##e of new products .
unlike the old - line cosmetics houses , un ##ile ##ver and p & g both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products .
p & g , in fact , is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition .
` ` you ' ll see fewer gi ##mm ##ick ##s . ' '
industry consultants say only sc ##hering - pl ##ough , which makes the mass - market maybe ##llin ##e , has maintained a meaningful business .
col ##gate , which acquired helena ruben ##stein in 1973 , sold the brand seven years later after the brand lang ##uis ##hed .
the ri ##tz ##y world of department - store cosmetics retail ##ing , where un ##ile ##ver is concentrating its efforts , may prove even more treacherous .
in this niche , makeup colors change seasonal ##ly because they are linked to ready - to - wear fashion ##s .
because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are un ##pl ##anne ##d , careful training of store sales staff ##s by cosmetics companies is important .
there may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the white house and congress over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad .
if that attitude lasts , it could in ##fus ##e covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n ' t been seen in years .
that was n ' t always the way the reagan administration handled such matters .
congress never fully trusted former cia chief william casey and national security adviser john po ##ind ##ex ##ter to honor the ban .
in return , the senate panel has dropped efforts to en ##act legislation requiring the administration to inform it within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity .
the new understanding did n ' t just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light .
it emerged after a ran ##cor ##ous display of old - style intelligence politics that followed this month ' s failed coup attempt in panama .
the white house used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressional ##ly imposed restrictions on covert actions made u . s . support for such coup ##s difficult .
the president also hinted he might veto this year ' s intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive .
sen . cohen said the relationship has reverted to its pre - reagan character .
there still are some details to be nailed down .
and a pending justice department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled .
some conservatives will accuse the president of promising congress too much .
and they continue anonymous ##ly attacking cia director william webster for being too acc ##om ##mo ##dating to the committee .

con ##tel is a $ 6 billion telephone and electronics company .
last month , program trading accounted for a record 13 . 8 % of average daily big board volume .
` ` their powerful members manage them . ' '
the focus of the out ##cr ##y has been stock - index ar ##bit ##rage , which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on .
the big board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading .
richard grass ##o , big board president , last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents .
one intended customer of the new basket product is index ar ##bit ##rage ##rs , according to the exchange .
investors have complained for some time about program trading , particularly index ar ##bit ##rage , to little avail .
but according to some big board traders , an organized campaign from exchange - listed companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes .
` ` they wo n ' t fight the listed companies .
now the assault is on , ' ' said one top trader .
however , he said he planned to spend the weekend making calls to gather additional support .
none of these chief executives were available for comment .
among the targets of the big board companies ' campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program - trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments .
it was just those kinds of ultimatum ##s that last week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate .
kidd ##er officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading .
' ' however , pressure on kidd ##er ' s parent , ge , could change kidd ##er ' s policy .
margaret thatcher ' s instinct ##ive response to the latest up ##hea ##val in her government is to promise business as usual .
mrs . thatcher has to come to terms with european economic integration , beginning with the european monetary system , which britain is committed to joining fully someday .
finally , the government has to convince a rattled financial community - - and voters - - it is proceeding coherent ##ly toward its goals .
it sounds like the work of a decade , but the deadline is late 1991 , when mrs . thatcher is expected to call another national election .
what ' s worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of ki ##lter with the political timetable .
she could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation , high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit .
though mrs . thatcher has pulled through other crises , supporters wonder if her steel ##y , auto ##cratic ways are the right formula today .
a continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate , currently 15 % .
economists have been anticipating a slump for months , but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought .
that would leave mrs . thatcher little room for maneuver .
for the tori ##es to win the next election , voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand .
though mrs . thatcher does n ' t need to call an election until june 1992 , she would prefer doing so in late 1991 .
there ' s an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the european community .
since then , the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join .
sir alan ass ##ailed the monetary arrangement as ` ` half - baked ' ' in an article being published in an american economics journal .
that produced little reaction from his boss , rein ##for ##cing speculation the government would use its two conditions as a pre ##text for avoiding full ems membership .
despite the departure of mr . lawson and sir alan , the tug - of - war over the ems could continue .
sir geoffrey howe , deputy prime minister and a lawson ally on the ems , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership .
as conservatives rally around mrs . thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes last week ' s de ##ba ##cle will prompt change .
` ` the party is fed up with sack ##ings of good people . ' '
as long as a decade ago , mrs . thatcher declared she did n ' t want debate in her cabinet ; she wanted strong government .
over the weekend , she said she did n ' t intend to change her style and denied she is authoritarian .
` ` nonsense , ' ' she told an interview ##er yesterday on london weekend television .

when husbands take on more house ##work , they tend to substitute for chores done by the kids rather than by the wife .
the women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the approximate share each did .
only for yard ##work and home maintenance did women do less than half .
this pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples .
in these families , husbands took on 80 % more chores than in couples with only grammar school education .
but the kids with highly educated parents did 68 % less house ##work than those in less - educated families .
her share decreases , but only slightly . ' '
far fewer elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed , two recent studies declare .
state governments place very low ceilings on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills .
but a remarkably high percentage - - over half - - are private pay ##ers throughout their stay , even a fairly lengthy one .
about one - third pay out of their own pockets , while the rest are covered throughout by medicare , private ins ##urer ##s or the veterans administration .

many political analysts have speculated that the reagan years would produce a staunch ##ly conservative younger generation .
nor ##c ' s most recent opinion surveys find the youngest adults indeed somewhat more pro - reagan and pro - republican than other adults .
they were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age group in the 1986 through 1989 surveys .
that compares with 58 % of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55 % in the 1972 through 1975 surveys .

a good measurement of the popularity of ice - breaker journals like og ##ony ##ok is circulation .

the c ##zar ##s were no civil libertarian ##s .

` ` i ' d be destroying myself , ' ' replies mr . ko ##rot ##ich , who then asks , ` ` what would that accomplish ?
' ' his answer reveals his vulnerability - - it also draws the line that soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of western culture .
it is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even ad ##mir ##able leaders .

federal reserve critics used to complain of ` ` stop and go ' ' monetary policies .
a supreme ##ly cautious man , the fed chairman is forever blinking yellow .
indeed , his caution has become legendary within the government .
he fuss ##es endless ##ly over economic statistics , di ##sse ##cting them in dozens of ways , probing for hours in search of potential problems .
such caution was evident after the recent friday - the - 13th stock market plunge .
some bush administration officials urged mr . greens ##pan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets .
but he refused , claiming that he wanted to see what happened monday morning before making any public statement .
mr . greens ##pan ' s decision to keep quiet also prompted a near - mutiny within the fed ' s ranks .
the statement angered chairman greens ##pan , but it was greeted with applause by the bush administration and the financial markets .
ironically , the anonymous official ' s comments have earned some pl ##aud ##its for mr . greens ##pan , who is mistakenly seen as the source .
a surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system .
bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that mr . greens ##pan is cautious to a fault .
those concerns are n ' t expressed in public .
the economy is showing signs of weakness , particularly among manufacturers .
exports , which played a key role in fuel ##ing growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled .
factory payroll ##s and production fell in september , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch .
but mr . greens ##pan remains reluctant to loosen policy , partly because he faces a ph ##ala ##nx of presidents of regional fed banks who oppose credit easing .
in addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road .
inflation may be stable at the moment , running at about 4 . 5 % .
but if the fed ease ##s too soon , mr . greens ##pan fears , prices may begin to accelerate again next year .
so far , mr . greens ##pan ' s cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well .
` ` i think you have to give greens ##pan a good rating . ' '
the fed ' s reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the ground ##work for a new recession , perhaps starting early next year .
if that happens , chairman greens ##pan could well become an open target .
already , congress is toy ##ing with legislation to curb the fed ' s independence .
if the economy turns down , such proposals could gain strong momentum .

in an age of specialization , the federal judiciary is one of the last bastion ##s of the general ##ist .
a judge must jump from murder to anti ##trust cases , from arson to securities fraud , without missing a beat .
but even on the federal bench , specialization is creeping in , and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court .
the court of appeals for the federal circuit was created in 1982 to serve , among other things , as the court of last resort for most patent disputes .
previously , patent cases moved through the court system to one of the 12 circuit appeals courts .
a new specialty court was sought by patent experts , who believed that the general ##ists had bot ##ched too many important , multi ##mill ##ion - dollar cases .
some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field .
but the reagan administration thought otherwise , and so may the bush administration .
since 1984 , the president has filled four va ##can ##cies in the federal circuit court with non - patent lawyers .
the latter two and judge daniel m . friedman , 73 , are approaching senior status or retirement .
the associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training .

kidd ##er , peabody & co . is trying to struggle back .
its relationship with parent general electric co . had been fray ##ed since a big kidd ##er insider - trading scandal two years ago .
now , the firm says it ' s at a turning point .
` ` i ' ve done what i came to do ' ' at kidd ##er , he says .
mr . carpenter says he will return kidd ##er to prominence as a great investment bank .
it ' s quite a fall from the early 1980s , when kidd ##er still was counted as an investment - banking powerhouse .
but they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one . ' '
in 1988 , kidd ##er ek ##ed out a $ 46 million profit , mainly because of severe cost cutting .
but even that niche is under attack , as several wall street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors .
there have been a dizzy ##ing parade of studies of the firm ' s operations .
more than 20 new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since january .
the firm ' s broker ##age force has been trimmed and its mergers - and - acquisitions staff increased to a record 55 people .
mr . carpenter says that when he assumes full control , kidd ##er will finally tap the resources of ge .
the leverage ##d buy - out group of ge capital now reports to mr . carpenter .
so far , instead of teaming up , ge capital staff ##ers and kidd ##er investment bankers have bi ##cker ##ed .
yet , says mr . carpenter , ` ` we ' ve really started to exploit the syn ##ergy between ge capital and kidd ##er peabody . ' '
the units have worked on 37 investment banking deals this year , he says , though not all of them have pan ##ned out .
` ` we ' ve had a good relationship with ge , which is the first time you could say that - - uh , let me withdraw that .
it ' s been a steadily improving relationship , ' ' says mr . carpenter .
everywhere , kidd ##er stresses the ` ` always working ' ' theme .

mr . lee , president of luzon pet ##ro ##chemical corp . , said the contract was signed wednesday in tokyo with us ##i far east officials .
contract details , however , have n ' t been made public .
the complex is to be located in bat ##anga ##s , about 70 miles south of manila .
us ##i far east will hold a 60 % stake in luzon pet ##ro ##chemical , according to papers signed with the philippine government ' s board of investments .
these are the raw materials used in making plastics .
the contract signing represented a major step in the long - planned pet ##ro ##chemical project .
at an estimated $ 360 million , the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the philippines since president cora ##zon aquino took office in february 1986 .
it also is considered critical to the country ' s efforts to both attract other investment from taiwan and raise heavy industry capabilities .
the project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade .
as previously reported , a member of the philippines ' house of representatives has sued to stop the plant .
the legislator , enrique garcia , had actively backed the plant , but at the original site in his constituency northwest of manila .
the country ' s supreme court dismissed the suit , but mr . garcia late last month filed for a rec ##ons ##ider ##ation .
the project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project , china general plastics corp . , backed out .
china general plastics , another taiwanese pet ##ro ##chemical manufacturer , was to have a 40 % stake in luzon pet ##ro ##chemical .
however , mr . lee said that us ##i far east is confident other investors will take up the slack .

president bush badly wants a line - item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president .
although that may sound like an arc ##ane maneuver of little interest outside washington , it would set off a political earthquake .
` ` it ' s a real face - to - face arm wrestling challenge to congress . ' '
they prefer to put off the line - item veto until at least next year .
still , mr . bush and some other aide ##s are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line - item veto .
the issue arose last week when vice president dan quay ##le told an audience in chicago that mr . bush was looking for a test case .
they maintain that a president needs the ability to surgical ##ly remove pork - barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills .
those bills ca n ' t easily be veto ##ed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating .
conservatives note that 43 governors have the line - item veto to use on state budgets .
` ` it puts this president in the legislative business , ' ' he declares .
` ` that ' s not what our fathers had in mind . ' '
he notes that , as a law ##maker from the san francisco area , he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the bay area rapid transit system .
proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line - item veto more ju ##dic ##iously than that .
big chunks of the government budget , like the en ##ti ##tlement programs of social security and medicare , would n ' t be affected .
governors have found that they have to use the device spa ##ring ##ly to maintain political com ##ity .
republicans have as much interest as democrats in ` ` the way the system works , ' ' he notes .
rep . edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it ' s a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person .
this has n ' t been kellogg co . ' s year .
the o ##at - bran cr ##az ##e has cost the world ' s largest cereal maker market share .
and now kellogg is indefinitely suspend ##ing work on what was to be a $ 1 billion cereal plant .
the company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions .
kellogg ' s current share is believed to be slightly under 40 % while general mills ' share is about 27 % .
each share point is worth about $ 60 million in sales .
kellogg is so anxious to turn around corn fl ##akes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents , trade sources say .
` ` they are not a happy group of people at battle creek right now . ' '
kellogg is based in battle creek , mic ##h . , a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world .
` ` i do n ' t think kellogg can get back to 40 % this year , ' ' he said .
` ` kellogg ' s main problem is life style .
people are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that ' s ` healthy ' for you - - o ##ats , bran . ' '
he said construction would n ' t resume until market conditions warrant it .
kellogg indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities .
general mills , meanwhile , finds itself constrained from boost ##ing sales further because its plants are operating at capacity .
a large plant in co ##vington , ga . , is to come on line next year .
initial cost estimates for the plant , which was to have been built in phases , ranged from $ 1 billion to $ 1 . 2 billion .
a company spokesman said it was ` ` possible , but highly unlikely , ' ' that the plant might never be built .
the new facility was to have been the world ' s most advanced cereal manufacturing plant , and kellogg ' s largest construction project .
the company had retained the flu ##or daniel unit of flu ##or corp . as general contractor .
but in recent weeks , construction - industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185 - acre site .
sub ##con ##tra ##ctors said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed .
flu ##or daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew , the sources said .
last year , the company earned $ 480 . 4 million , or $ 3 . 90 a share , on sales of $ 4 . 3 billion .
as expected , kellogg reported lower third - quarter earnings .
sales rose 4 . 8 % to $ 1 . 20 billion from $ 1 . 14 billion .
the company had a one - time charge of $ 14 . 8 million in the latest quarter covering the disposition of certain assets .

the state - owned industrial holding company instituto nacional de indus ##tri ##a and the bank of spain jointly hold a 13 . 94 % stake in banco exterior .
the government directly owns 51 . 4 % and factor ##ex , a financial services company , holds 8 . 42 % .
some analysts are concerned , however , that banco exterior may have waited too long to divers ##ify from its traditional export - related activities .
catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services , they argue , will be difficult , particularly if market conditions turn sour .
mr . luzon and his team , however , say they are n ' t interested in a merger .
instead , they are working to transform banco exterior into an efficient bank by the end of 1992 .
` ` i want this to be a model of the way a public - owned company should be run , ' ' mr . luzon says .
banco exterior was created in 1929 to provide sub ##si ##di ##zed credits for spanish exports .
the market for export financing was liberal ##ized in the mid - 1980s , however , forcing the bank to face competition .
at the same time , many of spain ' s traditional export markets in latin america and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth .
the bank was ham ##st ##run ##g in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts say .
until mr . luzon took the helm last november , banco exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes .
but mr . luzon has moved swiftly to stream ##line bureaucracy , cut costs , increase capital and build up new areas of business .
` ` we ' ve got a lot to do , ' ' he acknowledged .
` ` we ' ve got to move quickly . ' '
in mr . luzon ' s first year , the bank eliminated 800 jobs .
now it says it ' ll trim another 1 , 200 jobs over the next three to four years .
the bank employs 8 , 000 people in spain and 2 , 000 abroad .
the bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches .
last year ' s drop in export credit was partially offset by a 15 % surge in lending to individuals and small and medium - sized companies .
expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets .
the bank says it ' s interested in purchasing banks in morocco , portugal and puerto rico .
but the bank ' s retail activities in latin america are likely to be cut back .
banco exterior was one of the last banks to create a broker ##age house before the four spanish stock exchanges underwent sweeping changes in july .
the late start may be a handicap for the bank as spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition .
the bank also says it ' ll use its international network to channel investment from london , frankfurt , zurich and paris into the spanish stock exchanges .
general motors corp . ' s general counsel hopes to cut the number of outside law firms the auto maker uses from about 700 to 200 within two years .
gm trimmed about 40 firms from its approved local counsel list , mr . pearce says .
the move is consistent with a trend for corporate legal staff ##s to do more work in - house , instead of farming it out to law firms .
mr . pearce has also encouraged his staff to work more closely with gm ' s technical staff ##s to help prevent future litigation .
the lawyers also monitor suits to identify specific automobile parts that cause the biggest legal problems .
this does n ' t necessarily mean larger firms have an advantage ; mr . pearce said gm works with a number of smaller firms it regards highly .
federal prosecutors are concluding fewer criminal cases with trials .
that ' s a finding of a new study of the justice department by researchers at syracuse university .
david burnham , one of the authors , says fewer trials probably means a growing number of plea bargain ##s .
in 1980 , 18 % of federal prosecution ##s concluded at trial ; in 1987 , only 9 % did .
the justice department rejected the implication that its prosecutors are currently more willing to plea bargain .
the disc ##re ##pan ##cy is somewhat per ##plex ##ing in that the syracuse researchers said they based their conclusions on government statistics .
in 1980 , the study says , prosecutors surveyed filed charges against 25 defendants for each 100 , 000 people aged 18 years and older .
in 1987 , prosecutors filed against 35 defendants for every 100 , 000 adults .
another finding from the study : prosecutors set significantly different priorities .
the manhattan u . s . attorney ' s office stressed criminal cases from 1980 to 1987 , averaging 43 for every 100 , 000 adults .
but the new jersey u . s . attorney averaged 16 .
the study is to provide reporters , academic experts and others raw data on which to base further inquiries .
im ##eld ##a marcos asks for dismissal , says she was kidnapped .
mrs . marcos ' s attorneys asked federal judge john f . keenan to give them access to all u . s . documents about her alleged abduction .
lawyers for mrs . marcos say that because she was taken to the u . s . against her wishes , the federal court lacks jurisdiction in the case .
the indictment , which was sealed and apparently forgotten by investigators until 1987 , charges mr . ko ##sko ##tas and three others with tax fraud and other violations .
a federal judge in manhattan threw out the indictment , finding that the seven - year delay violated the defendant ' s constitutional right to a speedy trial .
the appeals court , however , said the judge did n ' t adequately consider whether the delay would actually hurt the chances of a fair trial .
his attorney could n ' t be reached for comment .
the consolidated firm , which would rank among the 10 largest in texas , would operate under the name jackson & walker .

a grand jury has been investigating whether officials at southern co . con ##sp ##ired to cover up their accounting for spare parts to evade federal income taxes .
the grand jury has also been investigating whether gulf power executives violated the federal utility holding company act , which prohibits certain utilities from making political contributions .
under one count , gulf power would plead guilty to con ##sp ##iring to violate the utility holding company act .
under the second count , the company would plead guilty to con ##sp ##iring to evade taxes .
the guilty pleas would be made solely by gulf power , the individuals said .

the fiscal 1989 budget deficit figure came out friday .
the next time you hear a member of congress moan about the deficit , consider what congress did friday .
then , by voice vote , the senate voted a pork - barrel bill , approved thursday by the house , for domestic military construction .
compare the bush request to what the senators gave themselves :
for construction in west virginia , mr . bush requested $ 4 . 5 million ; congress gave senator byrd ' s state $ 21 . 5 million .

in bombay stock market circles , the buzz ##word is ` ` mega . ' '
at least 40 companies are coming to the capital market to raise $ 6 billion , an amount never thought possible in india .
` ` the capital market is booming . ' '
but the mega - issues are raising mega ##quest ##ions about the rapidly evolving indian capital market .
one is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without de ##pressing stock trading .
a prospect ##us in india does n ' t always tell a potential investor much .
some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms .
in addition , once money is raised , investors usually have no way of knowing how it is spent .
some analysts are concerned that the mega - issues , in such an un ##re ##gul ##ated environment , could lead to a mega - crash .
` ` they ' re going to have mega - problems . ' '
the indian stock markets have been on a five - year high , with dip ##s and corrections , since prime minister raj ##iv gandhi started liberal ##izing industry .
but the last stock market boom , in 1986 , seems small compared with the current rush to market .
in fiscal 1984 , before mr . gandhi came to power , only $ 81 ##0 million was raised .
and it is n ' t the only giant issue : together , the top four issues will raise $ 1 . 3 billion .
these mega - issues are being propelled by two factors , economic and political .
as a result , industry operated out of small , expensive , highly in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt industrial units .
when mr . gandhi came to power , he ushered in new rules for business .
he said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside india and benefit from economies of scale .
if the output was too great for the domestic market , he said , companies should export .
india ' s over ##re ##gul ##ated businessmen had to be persuaded , but they have started to think big .
the second factor spur ##ring mega - issues is political .
some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than mr . gandhi ' s , and possibly more restrictive .
no one admits to anything , but india ' s industrialist ##s have a history of making under - the - table campaign donations .
so far , the mega - issues are a hit with investors .
earlier this year , tata iron & steel co . ' s offer of $ 355 million of convertible de ##ben ##tures was overs ##ub ##scribe ##d .
es ##sar gujarat ltd . , a marine construction company , had similar success with a slightly smaller issue .
larsen & to ##ub ##ro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month ; bankers and analysts expect it to be overs ##ub ##scribe ##d .
while many investors are selling parts of their portfolio ##s to buy the new issues , prices on india ' s 16 stock exchanges are holding up so far .
but with growth come growing pains , and never has this been clearer on the indian capital market than now .
in the past , the government controlled the markets indirectly , through its tight grip on industry itself .
but now , with large amounts being raised from investors , the government ' s da ##wd ##ling on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect .
mr . dave , its head , acts cheer ##y and patient , but he makes no bones about the need to get to work .
` ` mega or non - mega , we feel the prospect ##us standards need to be considerably improved , ' ' he says .
` ` disclosure ##s are very poor in india . ' '
instead , he says , most investors have to rely on the rumor - happy indian press .
an example is the biggest offering of them all , larsen & to ##ub ##ro ' s $ 570 million bond issue .
the engineering company was acquired in a takeover earlier this year by the giant reliance textile group .
although larsen & to ##ub ##ro had n ' t raised money from the public in 38 years , its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market .
once the money is raised , it is n ' t always certain how it is used .
larsen & to ##ub ##ro , for example , says it ' s raising $ 570 million to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs .
unlike other companies , it has n ' t pin - pointed specific projects for the funds .
and even when specific projects are described in prospect ##uses , the money often is used elsewhere , according to analysts .
` ` someone must monitor where the funds are deployed , ' ' says mr . dave .
mr . patel agrees : ` ` there is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds .
they ' re trying to plug the various loop ##holes , but they ' re totally un ##pre ##par ##ed for this . ' '
the government insists that such a possibility is low .
it says that despite loose regulation of the market itself , its long ##standing regulation of industry will prevent such crashes .

the pact also calls for coordination between finn ##air and switzerland ' s national carrier , swiss ##air , with which sas entered a similar alliance last month .
finn ##air and sas said they plan to swap stakes in each other .
finn ##air would receive sas shares valued at the same amount , officials said .
gm confirmed friday that it received permission late thursday from u . s . anti ##trust regulators to increase its jaguar holdings past the $ 15 million level .
a spokesman for gm , the no . 1 auto maker , declined to say how many jaguar shares that company owns .
trading volume was a moderately heavy 3 . 1 million shares .
british government restrictions prevent any single shareholder from going beyond 15 % before the end of 1990 without government permission .
the british government , which owned jaguar until 1984 , still holds a controlling ` ` golden share ' ' in the company .
with the golden share as protection , jaguar officials have re ##bu ##ffed ford ' s overture ##s , and moved instead to forge an alliance with gm .
jaguar officials have indicated they are close to wrapping up a friendly alliance with gm that would preserve jaguar ' s independence , but no deal has been announced .
ford , on the other hand , has said it ' s willing to bid for all of jaguar , despite the objections of jaguar chairman sir john egan .
but a ford spoke ##sw ##oman in dear ##born said friday the company has n ' t requested such a meeting yet .
individuals close to the situation believe ford officials will seek a meeting this week with sir john to outline their proposal for a full bid .
any discussions with ford could post ##pone the jaguar - gm deal , headed for completion within the next two weeks .
if there is n ' t , - lc ##b - the deal - rc ##b - wo n ' t be put forward ' ' to shareholders .
union sentiment also could influence shareholder reaction to a jaguar - gm accord .
these are the last words ab ##bie hoffman ever uttered , more or less , before he killed himself .

ab ##bie - l ##rb - con ##t ' d . - rr ##b - : ` ` i ' ll always be with you , jack .
ab ##bie lies back and leaves the frame empty .
ms . chung ' s , however , is said to be the only network news program in history to employ casting directors .
ab ##bie hoffman in this case is to be played by hollywood actor paul lie ##ber , who is n ' t new to the character .
he was mr . hoffman in a 1979 los angeles production of a play called ` ` the chicago conspiracy trial . ' '
television news , of course , has always been part show - bi ##z .
broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in capt ##ivating an audience .
it has depicted the bombing of pan am flight 103 over the scottish town of locker ##bie .

the marriage of news and theater , if not exactly inevitable , has been con ##sum ##mate ##d nonetheless .
nowhere have eyes been opened wider than at cbs news .
cbs news sends scripts to agents , who pass them along to clients .
james earl jones is cast to play the rev . mr . johns .

mr . su ##kle says he would n ' t dream of participating himself :
i think re - enactment ##s stink . ' '
though a re - enactment may have the flavor , hollywood on the hudson it is n ' t .
some producers seem tentative about the technique , sq ##ue ##ami ##sh even .
so the results , while not news , are n ' t exactly theater either , at least not good theater .
criticism of the ab ##bie hoffman segment is particularly sc ##athing among people who knew and loved the man .
that includes his companion of 15 years , johanna law ##ren ##son , as well as his former wife , anita .
` ` it ' s a sensation ##al piece about someone who is not here to defend himself . ' '
mrs . hoffman says that drama ##ti ##zation ` ` makes the truth flexible .
it takes one person ' s account and gives it authenticity . ' '
cbs news interviewed jack hoffman and his sister , phyllis , as well as mr . hoffman ' s landlord in sole ##bury township , pa .
also jonathan silver ##s , who collaborated with mr . hoffman on two books .
` ` i do n ' t talk about my work , ' ' he says .

last year , dent ##su started hd ##m , a joint network with u . s . ad agency young & rub ##ica ##m and euro ##com of france .
dent ##su has u . s . subsidiaries , but they keep low profiles .
` ` our president said acquisition is an effective method . ' '
so far , it appears cautious about taking the big step .
but he said dent ##su has n ' t looked seriously at sa ##at ##chi .
though dent ##su says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadline ##s , it is laying the ground ##work for international growth .
it is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad .
but success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trick ##ier than for other industries such as manufacturers .
on its own , dent ##su ' s muscle in japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non - japanese clients .
thus , an acquisition may prove the necessary course .
but japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different .
but the different business system would make it hard for dent ##su to provide these japanese companies the same kind of services they do in japan .
terms of the transaction were n ' t disclosed .

but the notebook , with the more advanced micro ##pro ##ces ##sor and hard disk , is more innovative .

it does n ' t have an internal floppy disk drive , although a snap - on drive can be purchased separately .
its greatest draw ##back may be its 3 - inch thickness , big enough for one consultant to describe it as ` ` cl ##unk ##y . ' '

shear ##son lehman hutton inc . said it applied to taiwanese securities officials for permission to open broker ##age offices in taipei .

retailers in the west and parts of the south are entering the critical christmas shopping season with more momentum than those in other regions .
sales increased a more modest 4 . 8 % in the south and 4 . 4 % in the midwest .
in the northeast , however , sales declined 0 . 4 % in the period , with sales in new england falling 2 . 6 % .
the numbers show that ` ` we do n ' t have a mono ##lithic economy , ' ' said isaac la ##gna ##do , council research director .
` ` there are a lot of have and have - not markets . ' '
sales nationally rose 3 . 9 % through july , the latest month for which the figures are available , the council said .
the northern california earthquake and hurricane hugo are likely to temporarily damp sales growth in the west and south carolina .
but mr . la ##gna ##do predicted the regional trends would continue through christmas .
` ` the big mo is as much of a factor in retail ##ing as in politics , ' ' he said .
the christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly half of their profits .
the council ' s report is based on data the trade group buys from the u . s . census bureau .
the council plans to release its regional reports monthly .
mr . la ##gna ##do said strength in employment appears to have the biggest impact on sales growth .
massachusetts , which has lost jobs in the computer and defense - related industries , was the weak ##est link in bleak new england .
the results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during the past two years .
in 1987 , the west had the slow ##est sales growth , and the south and the midwest were first and second respectively , according to the council .
stores such as sears that sell big - ticket durable goods might actually get a boost as consumers rush to replace items lost in the disasters , he said .

in may 1988 , an am ##monium perch ##lor ##ate plant in henderson owned by an american pacific corp . unit was leveled by a series of explosions .
after the explosion , kerr - mcgee temporarily shut down its facility just south of las vegas for a safety inspection .
american pacific and kerr - mcgee are the only two u . s . manufacturers of am ##monium perch ##lor ##ate .
that prompted kerr - mcgee to consider moving the potentially volatile storage facilities and cross - blending operations away from town .
kerr - mcgee said it has purchased 3 , 350 acres from the federal government in clark county and plans to begin construction early next year .
the new facility is expected to begin operations in early 1991 .
the henderson plant will continue its other chemical operations , the company said .

david l . ko ##ff ##man , president and chief executive officer of jaya ##rk , holds about 40 % of ko ##fc ##oh , jaya ##rk said .
jaya ##rk , new york , distribute ##s and rents audio - visual equipment and prints promotional ads for retailers .

the transaction is subject to approval by a panel of di ##sin ##ter ##ested directors , the company said , adding that shareholder approval is n ' t needed .

the new york mercantile exchange , the world ' s chief oil futures marketplace , is at a critical jun ##cture .
if the exchange fa ##lter ##s in these moves , they say , it might once again fall behind its chief new york competitor , the commodity exchange .
it also said that it would start trading the contract as soon as the cf ##tc approved it .
the cf ##tc has 90 days to respond to such applications .
the mer ##c first started working on developing this contract in 1984 .
mr . thompson first came to the exchange in 1981 and has been executive vice president since march 1988 .
he previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel .
by contrast , the come ##x in july imported a highly regarded outsider , arnold f . st ##alo ##ff , as its president .
mr . st ##alo ##ff , 44 , was a senior officer of the philadelphia stock exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products .
mr . thompson is n ' t be ##re ##ft of experience with new products , however .
in a recent interview , mr . thompson said the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image .
earlier this year , the u . s . attorney indicted 45 floor traders and one clerk at the two big chicago exchanges .
federal authorities in new york started investigating exchanges in may , though no indictment ##s have been handed down there .
so far they have issued scores of sub ##po ##enas , some of which went to members of the new york mer ##c .
mr . thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those sub ##po ##enas .
in a recent general accounting office study , the mer ##c was found to have been the most lax in enforcing exchange rules .
it levi ##ed the smallest number of suspension ##s of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years .
it also had both the few ##est , and least experienced , investigators per million contracts traded .
mr . conway is no longer at the exchange .
` ` we had a management breakdown in 1987 in terms of compliance , ' ' mr . thompson says .
` ` we recognized the problem and took care of it . ' '
for years the five new york exchanges have been talking about cooper ##ating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations .
periodically , there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges .
so far there is little to show for such efforts .
mr . thompson believes the case for working together is stronger now than ever .
` ` the cost of competition has become extremely high , ' ' he says .
` ` we must find ways to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges . ' '
he thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up .
one of those areas is the development of a hand - held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them .
the mer ##c is now cooper ##ating with the come ##x in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail .
the chicago exchanges also are working on such a device .
another major electronics problem faces mr . thompson - - the creation of a 24 - hour trading system that can be used outside normal trading hours .
mr . thompson says his exchange is n ' t waiting for the results of the chicago exchanges ' cooperation .
he views the $ 1 . 10 to $ 1 . 12 range as a buying opportunity and considers the market overs ##old .
he noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals this week and traders should keep an eye on wall street .
he added that talk of strike settlements at producing mines has been fully discount ##ed .
however , to resume the bull trend , according to mr . o ' neill , copper would have to close over $ 1 . 19 .
he said there are two reports this week that might affect prices : the purchasing managers report on wednesday and the unemployment report on friday .
friday ' s strong price gains confirmed a turn ##around in the precious metals markets , according to pain ##ew ##eb ##ber ' s mr . fra ##wley .
` ` most traders will be looking to buy - lc ##b - on - rc ##b - pull ##backs , ' ' he said .
he thought the moves in the metals last week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets .
he said last week ' s activity in gold could porte ##nd a move to $ 390 an ounce for the december contract .
he said traders should be on the lookout for how metals producers react to this rally .
he noted that for the first time in months there was some light investor interest in the metals .
that selling of futures contracts by elevators is what helps keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harvest .
traders will also watch for whether the soviet union continues its traditional fall buying of u . s . grain .
so far this month , the soviets have bought about 7 . 2 million metric tons of u . s . corn .
there may be some activity in soy ##be ##an prices this week as investors try to get rid of the contract for november delivery .
in addition to wage increases , the union negotiated improved vacation plans , benefit packages and pension plans , mr . slot ##nick said .
he said more than 70 % of the bargaining unit voted in favor of the agreement .
wall street is just about ready to line the bird cage with paper stocks .
but now the companies are getting into trouble because they undertook a record expansion program while they were raising prices sharply .
` ` put your money in a good utility or bank stock , not a paper company , ' ' advises george adler of smith barney .
other analysts are nearly as pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic .
paper companies con ##cede that business has been off recently .
but they attribute much of the weakness to customer inventory reductions .
` ` it wo n ' t be an earth ##sha ##king drop , ' ' a we ##yer ##hae ##user spokesman says .
op ##pen ##heimer ' s mr . palmer ##o , meanwhile , is steering clear of gay ##lord container , stone container and federal paper board .
mr . schneider is cool to georgia pacific and ab ##iti ##bi - price .
lawrence ross of pain ##ew ##eb ##ber would avoid union camp .
the companies in question believe the analysts are too pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic .
great northern ne ##ko ##osa said , ` ` the odds of the dire predictions about us being right are small . ' '
he expects the price for that product to rise even more next year .
gay ##lord container said analysts are skeptical of it because it ' s carrying a lot of debt .
louisiana pacific and georgia pacific said a number of other analysts are recommend ##ing them because of their strong wood - products business .
federal paper board said , ` ` we ' re not as exposed as the popular perception of us . ' '
wall street is n ' t avoiding everything connected with paper .
a temple - inland spokesman said the company expects record earnings in 1989 , and ` ` we ' re still pretty bull ##ish ' ' on 1990 .
the analysts say their gloom ##y forecast ##s have a flip side .
some take a warm view of consumer - oriented paper companies , which buy pulp from the commodity producers and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices .
estimates on how much pulp prices will fall next year currently run between $ 150 and $ 250 a metric ton .
analysts agree that the price drop should especially benefit the two big tissue makers , scott paper and kimberly - clark .
a spokesman for scott says that assuming the price of pulp continues to soft ##en , ` ` we should do well .
the restaurant operator cited transaction costs from its 1988 rec ##ap ##ital ##ization as a result of a $ 160 million restructuring of its bank debt .
the write - off will be reported as an extraordinary item in the company ' s 1989 operating results .
in addition , the effective interest rate on the $ 410 million of total remaining bank debt after the restructuring is 10 . 66 % .
the combined effect of these changes is expected to save the company about $ 4 million in interest expenses next year , or six cents a share .
the company has made payments of $ 175 million against the original $ 58 ##5 million of bank debt incurred in connection with the rec ##ap ##ital ##ization .
ab ##b as ##ea brown bo ##ver ##i b . v . said it signed a contract for the largest - ever power plant order in the netherlands .
the accord is for a turbo ##gen ##era ##tor plant at the coal - fired power station hem ##we ##g in amsterdam .
ab ##b as ##ea brown bo ##ver ##i is the dutch unit of the swedish - swiss electrical engineering group ab ##b as ##ea brown bo ##ver ##i ag .
the dutch utility firm serves the amsterdam and utrecht areas .
the planned turbo ##gen ##era ##tor plant is expected to go into operation in 1994 .
during the next decade , mr . ku ##me said , nissan plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside japan .
but by 1992 , he added , nissan will build one million vehicles a year outside japan , or sufficient to equal exports .

the sale of the ex ##tr ##usion division is subject to audit adjustments for working capital changes through the closing .
the agreement also provides for potential payments of additional proceeds to national aluminum over the next two years , depending on the plant ' s shipping levels .

in fiscal 1989 , it had sales of about $ 40 million and an operating loss of $ 1 . 5 million .
commercial banks and property \ / casualty ins ##urer ##s , which together own about 36 % of all municipal bonds , have been dumping their securities for weeks .
last week , traders said , there were three institutional sellers for every buyer .
` ` every day we ' re getting new bid lists ' ' from would - be sellers , one trader said .
` ` most dealers can not continue to absorb this supply . ' '
` ` there is incredible negative psychology building in the market , ' ' said donna ave ##dis ##ian , a vice president at merrill lynch & co .
` ` people are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers . ' '
the yield on a group of 25 revenue bonds compiled by the bond buyer , a trade publication , now exceeds 7 . 50 % .
that ' s a taxa ##ble - equivalent yield nearly three percentage points more than the current yield on 30 - year treasury bonds .
this past summer , investors ' appetite for municipal bonds seemed ins ##ati ##able .
bond market analysts say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors .
` ` we do n ' t need the shelter of tax - free bonds , ' ' said a spoke ##sw ##oman at chemical .
in recent weeks , traders said , chemical has sold more than $ 1 billion of tax - free bonds .
the spoke ##sw ##oman confirmed that the bank has significantly reduced its mu ##ni holdings , but could n ' t immediately confirm the amount .
insurance companies are rushing to sell before the end of the year , when some of their tax benefits associated with municipal bonds will be phased out .
some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign .
mutual funds , for example , are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash to buy new issues .
such bonds , she says , are those that are nearing their call date .
but traders said the market ' s tone could pick up this week if new york city ' s $ 78 ##7 million bond offering goes well .
the offering will include $ 72 ##9 million of 20 - year tax - exempt bonds and $ 57 . 8 million of taxa ##ble bonds .
a few weeks ago , new york sold $ 750 million of tax - exempt ##s .
new york city bonds have been beaten down for three straight weeks .
on friday , some issues fell nearly one point , or close to $ 10 for each $ 1 , 000 face amount .
the city ' s economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling .
` ` the city has issued so much supply recently that some people are getting a little concerned .
but he thinks investors may be over ##rea ##cting to the market ' s problems .
overall , he says , municipal prices are ` ` very cheap ' ' and represent an ` ` excellent buying opportunity . ' '
the issue ' s yield rose to 7 . 93 % from 7 . 88 % .

thomas jefferson sold congress on the idea of the decimal system for currency , thus saving americans the headache ##s of pounds , shillings and pen ##ce .
but he struck out with the decimal system of metric weights and measures the french had invented .
instead , congress opted for the inches , feet and yards the colonists had brought with them .
americans did n ' t dislike metric ##s ; they simply ignored them .
by the end of the century scientists had embraced the system .
when congress finally passed the metric conversion act in 1975 , industry was far ahead .
because the law made compliance voluntary , it inspired little more than jokes .
today , though the public is barely aware , much of u . s . industry , particularly companies manufacturing or selling overseas , have made metric ##s routine .

the number of issues falling on the new york stock exchange each day is ec ##lip ##sing the number of gain ##ers .

but why should an if ##fy $ 6 . 79 billion leverage ##d buy - out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock market ?
sure , price action is volatile and that ' s scary , but all - in - all stocks are still a good place to be , they suggest .
` ` ua ##l is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned .

the pop sober ##ed up investors who had been getting a little too e ##bu ##llie ##nt , says mr . jarrett .
but he figures that at current levels the stock market is comfortably valued , even with the economy obviously slowing .
he ' s now est ##imating that after a period of consolidation , the dow jones industrial average will once again forge new highs .
her view is that stock prices have three major props : merger and buy - out proposals , earnings and the economic outlook .
at current levels of economic activity and earnings , stocks are fairly valued , she says .
but that ' s not the only problem for stocks .
the other two props - - earnings and the economic outlook - - are tr ##ou ##bling , too .
` ` m & a is getting all the headlines right now , but these other things have been building up more gradually , ' ' she says .
with all this , can stock prices hold their own ?
` ` the question is una ##ns ##wer ##able at this point , ' ' she says .
if the economy slips into a recession , then this is n ' t a level that ' s going to hold . ' '
stock prices tumbled for a third consecutive day as earnings disappointment ##s , a slug ##gis ##h economy and a fragile junk bond market continued to weigh on investors .

a frozen mountain ##top in tibet may offer an important clue about whether the earth is warming per ##ilo ##usly .
to compare temperatures over the past 10 , 000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen .
these measurements can indicate temperature changes , researchers said , because the rates of eva ##por ##ation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change .
sk ##ept ##ics say that if that ' s the case , temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over the past century , reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide .
other temperature data show similar une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d swings .

although we were white , the same economic factors affected us as affects the black people mr . far ##ney writes about .
most of the land in that and other parts of the delta are now owned by second , third or fourth generations of the same families .
and today , many of their children , grandchildren and great - grandchildren remain on welfare .
in the meantime , the landowners continue receiving generous subsidies that began during new deal days .
or those who choose not to farm can lease their lands and crop all ##ot ##ments for handsome sums .
and when they were no longer needed , they were turned loose un ##pre ##par ##ed to build lives of their own .
because the cycle of poverty along the lower mississippi goes back so many generations , breaking this cycle will be next to impossible .
sadly , the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral .
yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves .
because we refuse to face the tough answers , the questions continue as f ##od ##der for the commissions and committees , for the media and politicians .

management advised employees friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8 % , or 400 people .
mob ##il exploration & producing u . s . inc . , the group involved , currently has a work force of somewhat less than 5 , 000 .
a few years ago , mob ##il rest ##ructured the entire company during an industry ##wide shake ##out .
but since then u . s . oil production has declined and mob ##il wants to focus its oil - finding efforts overseas .
mob ##il officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters .
on wednesday , mob ##il will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its u . s . production operation .
mob ##il officials said they have been studying ways of stream ##lining these operations since early this year .
during the coming months , layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous .
for greater efficiency , employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction , mob ##il said .
but the staff ##s at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased .

wanted : an investment that ' s as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about .
with $ 150 billion of cds mat ##uring this month , a lot of people have been sc ##ouring the financial landscape for just such an investment .
now , the nationwide average yield on a six - month cd is just under 8 % , and 8 . 5 % is about the best around .
but investors looking for alternatives are n ' t finding it easy .
yields on most fixed - income securities are lower than several months ago .
and the stock market ' s recent g ##yra ##tions are a painful reminder of the dangers there .
there are , however , some alternatives that income - oriented investors should consider , investment advisers say .
a mix of cds and other holdings may make the most sense .
here ' s a look at some of the alternatives :
investors with a heavy tax load should take out their cal ##cula ##tors .
yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after - tax yields on cds for mat ##urities of perhaps one to five years .
that ' s because municipal - bond interest is exempt from federal income tax - - and from state and local taxes too , for in - state investors .
rates approach 6 . 5 % on five - year municipal ##s .
some of the more cautious cd holders might like ` ` pre - ref ##und ##ed ' ' municipal ##s .
the idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates .
bond mutual funds offer divers ##ification and are easy to buy and sell .
buyers can look forward to double - digit annual returns if they are right .
but they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead .
bond res ##ale prices , and thus fund share prices , move in the opposite direction from rates .
the price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities length ##ens .
consider , for instance , two bond funds from vanguard group of investment co ##s . that were both yielding 8 . 6 % on a recent day .
if interest rates do n ' t change , bond fund investors ' returns will be about equal to the funds ' current yields .
aimed specifically at cd holders are so - called cd - type ann ##uit ##ies , or certificates of ann ##uity .
ann ##uit ##ies are rarely a good idea at age 35 because of the withdrawal restrictions .
that ' s right , money market mutual funds .
the conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present , when rates seem headed down .
that ' s because top - yielding funds currently offer yields almost 1 1 \ / 2 percentage points above the average cd yield .
mr . wit ##man likes the dr ##ey ##fus worldwide dollar money market fund , with a seven - day compound yield just under 9 . 5 % .
a new fund , its operating expenses are being temporarily sub ##si ##di ##zed by the sponsor .
if rates unexpectedly rise , the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower - than - expected return from the bond fund .
the united kingdom reports came from dr . patrick to ##sel ##and , head of clinical chemistry at guy ' s hospital in london .
at least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young dia ##bet ##ics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year , he said .
the usual warning signs of h ##yp ##og ##ly ##ce ##mia include sweating , anxiety and cr ##amps .
with proper warning , dia ##bet ##ics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugar ##y food .
however , he said officials conducting the study had n ' t been looking for signs of problems related to h ##yp ##og ##ly ##ce ##mia unaware ##ness .
` ` we are now monitoring for it much more closely , ' ' he said .
` ` we do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal insulin ##s drive down blood sugar , ' ' dr . sob ##el said .
the human - based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster , he said .
` ` but we do n ' t believe there is enough of a difference to be clinical ##ly significant , ' ' dr . sob ##el said .
reports of dr . to ##sel ##and ' s findings in the british press have triggered widespread concern among dia ##bet ##ics there .
eli lilly & co . , the indianapolis - based drug manufacturer , dominates the u . s . human insulin market with its product known as hum ##ulin .

defense intellectuals have complained for years that the pentagon can not determine priorities because it has no strategy .
we ' d do the strategy and then we ' d come around and do the budget .
this city does n ' t work that way . ' '
compare the past eight five - year plans with actual appropriations .
the pentagon ' s st ##rate ##gist ##s produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats .
strategy , however , is about possibilities , not hopes and dreams .
by ignoring costs , u . s . st ##rate ##gist ##s abd ##icate their responsibility for hard decisions .
that puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others : bean counters , budget ##eers , and pork - barrel ##ers .
st ##rate ##gist ##s should consider the impact of budget uncertain ##ties at the beginning of the planning process .
they ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic budget scenarios would change the defense program .
they would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets .
they would also identify the best way to add programs , should the budget come in at higher levels .
this kind of con ##ting ##ency analysis is common in war planning and business planning .
there is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning .
two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action .
that plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ 45 billion .
to make the books balance , as is required by law , somebody invented a new budget line item that simply sub ##tracted $ 45 billion .
it is known in the pentagon as the ` ` negative wedge . ' '
the 1990 plan also assumes inflation will decline to 1 . 7 % by 1994 .
most forecast ##ers , including those in the congressional budget office , assume inflation will be in excess of 4 % in each of those five years .
at that rate , the defense plan is under ##fu ##nded by $ 48 billion .
step 2 examines how four progressively lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security .
note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations .
step 2 will answer the question : what happens if these increases do not material ##ize ?
scenario 3 , the ` ` current dollar freeze , ' ' has been the approximate position of the house of representatives for about four years .
it freeze ##s the budget at its current level , and forces the pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994 .
finally , scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2 % per year for the next five years - - a total reduction of $ 287 billion .
the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario , maxim ##izing strengths and mini ##mi ##zing weaknesses .
this exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the st ##rate ##gist ##s to make hard decisions .
these trade - offs would evolve priorities by revealing when the cost of the b - 2 became prohibit ##ive .
anyway , z ##bb ' s procedures were so cum ##bers ##ome that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of marginal ##ia .
but in the end , it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons .
if we want meaningful priorities , we must understand the trade - offs they imply before we make commitments .

the pound was at 2 . 88 ##9 ##6 marks late friday , off sharply from 2 . 95 ##11 in new york trading a week earlier .
but such an increase , he says , could be viewed by the market as ` ` too little too late . ' '

hong kong financial institutions have been waiting for interest - rate futures for a long time .
the subsequent drive to reform hong kong ' s markets also has em ##bro ##iled the interest - rate futures contract .
but regulators this week said futures - exchange officials still have a way to go before they answer all the remaining detailed questions about the contract .
the exchange had forecast that the contract would begin trading by december .
but securities regulators now say privately that it is n ' t likely to start until the first quarter of next year .
many believe that without a healthy futures exchange , hong kong ' s aspirations to be recognized as an international financial center will suffer .
in addition , local banks say the new contract is important in helping them offset their hong kong - dollar exposure .
the contract will be based on the three - month hong kong inter ##bank offered rate , or hi ##bor .
if the contract is as successful as some expect , it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in hong kong .
` ` the contract is definitely important to the exchange , ' ' says robert gilmore , executive director of the securities and futures commission .
two years ago , the futures exchange was the envy of other would - be futures centers .

trading in hang sen ##g index futures remains crippled by the experience .
despite the thin trading , and after two painful years of restructuring , the futures market has shown itself to be res ##ili ##ent in two recent tests .
that was also the case in the days following the june 4 massacre in beijing , which caused a sharp drop in hong kong stock prices .
` ` there was no problem at all , ' ' says douglas ford , chief executive officer of the futures exchange .
the two big banks were instrumental in designing the new contract .
colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous hong kong - dollar exposure .
despite the initial support expected , trading in the contract is likely to start slowly .
companies and financial institutions familiar with hong kong remain wary of trading in its futures market .
he says the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading 500 to 1 , 000 lots a day .
that should help to inspire confidence , mr . gilmore says .
but many bankers remain nervous , especially as the start - up of the contract continues to be delayed .

european community employers fear that the ec commission ' s plans for a ` ` charter of fundamental social rights ' ' is a danger to industrial competitive ##ness .
the british government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form .
it argues , as does un ##ice , that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level .
france will propose a slightly watered - down version of the charter to be discussed by ec social - affairs ministers on monday , officials said .
but the cosmetic changes are n ' t expected to win over britain .
mr . ty ##sz ##kiewicz said the charter would put poorer ec countries such as spain , greece and portugal at a disadvantage .
this , he warned , would prevent these countries from br ##id ##ging the difference with their richer ec brethren .
but the un ##ice official said that producing a charter acceptable to both britain and european industry is n ' t an una ##tta ##ina ##ble goal .
the charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers ' fundamental rights , without seeking to impose any norms .
this provision lies at the heart of the british and un ##ice fears of ` ` social engineering ' ' by the commission .
this would leave britain free to adopt the charter after having re ##bu ##tted the action program .
the charter was approved by the ec commission on sept . 21 .

after a three - year nightmare of uncertain oil prices , dr ##aco ##nian budget cuts and sweeping lay ##offs , fear is finally leaving the oil patch .
independent drill ##ers are gingerly sinking bits into the earth ' s crust again .
some in big oil are easing the grip on their wallet ##s .
investment capital is creeping back , and oil properties are fetch ##ing more .
oil - tool prices are even ed ##ging up .
in broad ##est terms , stability has quietly settled into international oil markets .
mid ##ea ##st politics have calmed down and the sq ##ua ##bbling within the organization of petroleum export ##ing countries seems under control for now .
after years of wild swings , oil prices over the last 12 months have settled at around $ 15 to $ 20 a barrel .
that is n ' t the $ 40 that delighted producers a decade ago or the $ 10 that pleased users a year ago .
not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again .
a recession or new op ##ec blow ##up could put oil markets right back in the soup .
also , the new stirring ##s are faint , and some question their extent .
drilling activity is still far below eight years ago , there ' s no hiring surge and some companies continue to shrink .
with all this , even the most wary oil men agree something has changed .
` ` it does n ' t appear to be getting worse .
that in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic , ' ' says glenn cox , the president of phillips petroleum co .
though modest , the change reaches beyond the oil patch , too .
now , at least some predict ##ability has returned , for everyone from economists to motor ##ists .
prices had been so unstable that two years ago mr . za ##ves gave up on long - term forecast ##s .
and consumers ` ` should be comfortable , ' ' adds w . henson moore , u . s . deputy secretary of energy .
` ` i do n ' t see anything on the horizon that could lead to a pre ##ci ##pit ##ous rise in the price . ' '
the catalyst for all this has been op ##ec .
saudi arabia , op ##ec ' s king ##pin , abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota - cheat ##ers .
about the same time , the iran - iraq war , which was roi ##ling oil markets , ended .
in addition , global petroleum demand has been climbing .
it is projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day , or up to 2 % annually , for years to come .
the resulting firm prices and stability ` ` will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently , ' ' says saudi arabian oil minister his ##ham na ##zer .
op ##ec secretary - general sub ##rot ##o explains : consumers offer security of markets , while op ##ec provides security of supply .
to promote this balance , op ##ec now is finally confronting a long - sim ##mering internal problem .
being held well below capacity greatly ir ##rita ##tes them , and has led to widespread cheating .
op ##ec has repeatedly raised its self - imposed production ceiling to leg ##iti ##mi ##ze some of that unauthorized output .
that would send prices plum ##met ##ing from what some gun - shy u . s . oil executives still regard as too low a level .

` ` talk is that everybody is going to drill more wells , ' ' says foreman tommy f ##ols ##om .
santa fe aims to drill about 30 wells in this area in 1989 and double that next year .
` ` we went to six companies over two days pitching the prospect , ' ' says tim parker , a santa fe exploration manager .
mitchell energy & development corp . became the partner , pony ##ing up more than half of the $ 600 , 000 in drilling and start - up costs .
mitchell will get a half - interest in the oil .
now ` ` everybody is a lot more optimistic . ' '
one attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the bargain - basement cost of drilling and equipment , reflecting service companies ' hunger for work .
ka ##dan ##e oil co . , a small texas independent , is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others .
the activity is enough to move some oil - service prices back up a little .
some drill - bit prices have risen 5 % in the past month .
some service boats recently were auction ##ed for about $ 1 . 7 million each , up from less than $ 1 million two years ago .
most oil companies , when they set exploration and production budgets for this year , forecast revenue of $ 15 for each barrel of crude produced .
prices have averaged more than $ 2 a barrel higher than that - - not a wind ##fall , but at least a pleasant bonus for them .
it says 40 % of those surveyed report that 1989 exploration spending will exceed 1988 ' s .
funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable .

being a travel agent used to be pretty g ##lam ##orous .
in recent months , more than 25 agencies have been robbed , compared with only a handful all last year , according to police and travel - agency groups .
most of the cases have been in california , where one agent was stabbed and another was shot and killed .
los angeles police say the thieves seem to be part of a crime network that knows how to convert blank tickets into real ones .
already , the stolen tickets have been used for flights all over the world .
so far , the thieves have stolen 3 , 63 ##2 blank tickets , according to airline reporting corp . , a ticket processing center .
but then , he says , they put two loaded pistols to his temple and demanded he open the safe .
when he initially refused , he says , they stabbed him in the back and made off with $ 2 , 000 and 280 blank tickets .
` ` they said they wanted to show me how serious they were , ' ' he says .

consumer advocates have long claimed that car rental companies charge too much for car rental insurance .
now , a new law in texas seems to be providing the proof .
specifically , the law says the rates must closely reflect what the company ' s actual expenses have been to replace damaged cars .
before the law went into effect last month , car rental companies were charging as much as $ 12 a day for the wai ##ver in texas .
now , they ' re charging as little $ 3 a day .
the state attorney general ' s office is investigating rental car agencies charging noticeably higher prices .
if your flight attendant seems a little weary , it may be because he or she has been working 20 straight hours .

for instance , tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation .

why do you continually ignore the sal ##ub ##rio ##us effects of index ##ing the basis of capital gains for inflation ?
why do you maintain the house - passed capital - gains plan is a ` ` temporary ' ' reduction when it is not ?
i think the reason is that you are confusing tax ` ` rates ' ' with tax ` ` payments . ' '
your sept . 29 page - one story on the house - passed capital - gains plan is a good example .
you lead readers to believe that the house reduced the capital - gains tax for two years only .
you virtually ignore the tax - reducing power of index ##ation , which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate .
as you can see , the capital - gains reduction plan adopted by the house would not be temporary , but permanent .
i hope that you begin talking about the plan ' s permanent and , in my view , most beneficial feature - - index ##ation .

that the motivation for the two - year reduction to 19 . 6 % is budget ##ary does not mean it is not in the public interest .
the reduction ease ##s the burden on portfolio changes and free ##s capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses .
but what is really significant is the index ##ation of capital gains after 1991 .
a large part of the long - term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation - created capital gains is con ##fi ##sca ##tion .

a potentially safer who ##oping cough vaccine made by novel genetic engineering techniques was described by a team of italian , u . s . and japanese scientists .
the team reported they managed to induce bacteria to produce a non - toxic version of the poison ##s produced by the bacterium that causes who ##oping cough .
the vaccine is effective in preventing a disease that still af ##flict ##s about 60 million children a year world - wide , causing an estimated one million deaths .
the vaccine , however , causes allergic reactions that can be fatal .
the reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole bo ##rde ##tell ##a per ##tus ##sis bacterium , which causes who ##oping cough .
this bacterium produces a toxin that , if used as a vaccine , can induce immunity to who ##oping cough .
the researchers reported they have been able to pl ##uck the five genes that produced the toxin out of the per ##tus ##sis bacterium .
it turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin , only one was responsible for the toxin ' s vi ##ru ##lence .
the researchers said they did this , but the toxin did n ' t induce immunity to who ##oping cough .
the scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the one gene that caused vi ##ru ##lence .
these bacterial ` ` cousins ' ' or ##dina ##rily do n ' t make the toxin .
but the genes were accompanied by a piece of dna , called a promoter , that turns the genes on .
the new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing per ##tus ##sis toxin which , because of the mutant vi ##ru ##lence gene , was no longer toxic .

unless , of course , it happens to be run by the rothschild ##s .
yet the rothschild ##s do n ' t deny an emotional element to the decision .
the original bank in frankfurt closed in 1901 after the death of wilhelm carl von rothschild , and the family ' s banking activities focused on london and paris .
much of the family ' s my ##sti ##que remained .
the family ' s long absence is understand ##able .
the family was in allied countries during both world war i and the long period of economic strife of the 1920s .
during the third reich , the rothschild ##s were a target of nazi propaganda against jewish fin ##an ##cier ##s .
the persecution pursued the rothschild ##s across europe as the nazis grabbed countries , con ##fi ##sca ##ting the family ' s property in the process .
in the immediate postwar years , the rothschild ##s concentrated on rebuilding their other european operations , delaying their return to frankfurt .
indeed , the competition is n ' t greatly concerned .
` ` it would be surprising if they did n ' t come to frankfurt in time for 1992 , and they bring an interesting tradition .
the constraints do n ' t bother the office ' s 54 - year - old manager , erich st ##rom ##eyer .
each rothschild bank is linked by family ties and cross - ownership .
the paris bank does n ' t publish that figure .
in europe , the rothschild ##s banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as european industry rest ##ru ##cture ##s ahead of 1992 .
yet the group ' s limited resources makes it a niche player .
among them , he says , is the family ' s traditional ties to old wealth and decision - makers in banking and industry throughout europe and beyond .
the rothschild ##s hope to use a long history in private banking and an aura of ex ##cl ##us ##ivity to attract private and institutional investors .
as program trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock market g ##yra ##tions , a few people on wall street say it is time to consider extreme measures .
the real answer to curb ##ing wild swings in stock prices , they say , might be to curb or even ab ##olis ##h stock - index futures .
but increasingly , people are questioning that view , and the critics include some of the country ' s most successful investors .
warren buffet ##t has been on record as opposing stock - index futures since their inception in 1982 .
and those who remain , he says ` ` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies . ' '
essentially , the critics of stock - index futures fall into two camps .
while it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices , traders now routinely check the futures markets in chicago before they buy or sell stocks .
when chicago futures prices jump up or down , the new york stock exchange follows .
on tuesday , for instance , the dow jones industrial average plunged 80 points in little more than an hour .
then , in the space of a 20 - minute coffee break , the average rallied almost all of the way back .
` ` the fundamental ##s do n ' t change in an hour , ' ' he says .
` ` i think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing . ' '
it ' s too disrupt ##ive , ' ' he says .
` ` it is n ' t investing . ' '
but stock - index futures have plenty of support .
defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks .
they note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures .
and , defenders say , few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising .
futures , he says , merely cut down on trading costs .
he says ` ` blaming futures is like blaming the messenger . ' '
despite the current out ##cr ##y over stock market vol ##ati ##lity , few people expect stock futures to disappear .
for one thing , the chicago futures exchanges have political and financial cl ##out - - including many friends in congress .
and traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape .
` ` all life is about change - - either you adapt or die , ' ' says one chicago futures trader .
` ` if futures are n ' t permitted here , we ' ll take it to australia or tokyo . ' '
average daily volume in s & p 500 futures last year was 44 , 87 ##7 contracts .
based on yesterday ' s closing price of the s & p , the average value of one day ' s trading amounts to $ 7 . 6 billion .

many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolio ##s .

by contrast , average dollar volume on the big board last year was $ 5 . 3 billion .
many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolio ##s .
one reason futures are said to add vol ##ati ##lity is that - - unlike in stocks - - people can spec ##ulate in futures with little money down .
margin requirements for spec ##ulator ##s on the chicago mercantile exchange are currently about 7 % .
` ` for $ 10 million , you can move $ 100 million of stocks , ' ' a specialist on the big board grip ##es .
` ` that gives futures traders a lot more power . ' '
by contrast , an investor in stocks must put up 50 % in cash .
some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity , rather than as investments in individual businesses .
` ` it took away the need to know the bad third - quarter report of ibm , for example , ' ' mr . ke ##gler says .
of course , portfolio trading - - the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks - - also treats stocks as homo ##gen ##ous commodities .
the s & p futures are merely a ` ` cheaper and quicker ' ' way to get access to all 500 stocks , he says .
the big board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the s & p 500 stocks .
but owning index futures is n ' t the same as owning the underlying stocks .
stock ##holders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices .
futures , on the other hand , are a zero sum game - - a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices .
` ` you do n ' t own anything , ' ' says stephen bo ##ese ##l , a money manager for t . rowe price in baltimore .
` ` you ' re making a pure bet on the market .
the european community commission challenged an agreement on routes and fares between france ' s two largest airlines on anti ##trust grounds .
an ec spokesman said the two companies will be notified so they can begin negotiations with brussels on how to modify the pact .
the two shared results from this route swap , and followed rules on ticket pricing .
the ec commission decided that such an accord does n ' t benefit consumers enough to merit an exemption from anti ##trust law .
the airlines presented it as offering consumers more choice and better flight connections .
an air france spoke ##sw ##oman said , ` ` we ' re absolutely ready to study all solutions . ' '
the indictment charged that p ##ym ##m operated a machine to crush broken the ##rm ##ometer ##s and recover the mercury in an illegal work ##room .
the charges said that one worker suffered permanent brain damage from mercury exposure .
but the appellate division of state supreme court held that federal law did n ' t pre - em ##pt the states from such a prosecution .
lawyers for the company and executives could n ' t be reached for comment .
the executives face five to 15 years in prison and fines of $ 5 , 000 or double the profit made by failing to comply with the rules .
the company could be fined a maximum of $ 10 , 000 , or double the profit .
gm is close to completing a friendly deal with jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual 30 % stake and joint manufacturing ventures .
since tuesday , the shares have gained nearly 4 % .

ford is willing to bid for 100 % of jaguar ' s shares if both the government and jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti - takeover barrier prematurely .
the government probably would n ' t give in readily to a hostile for ##ay by ford , however .
in woo ##ing british law ##makers , gm has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep jaguar british - owned and independent .
while the visit was unrelated to jaguar , gm chairman roger smith answered the legislators ' questions about it over lunch tuesday .
he said jaguar ` ` should n ' t be sm ##oth ##ered by anyone else , ' ' recalled one participant .
politics also influences the government ' s thinking on the anti - takeover restriction .
in the end , sir john - - rather than the government or jaguar shareholders - - may hold the key that unlock ##s the golden share .

when president bush travels to costa rica today , he ' ll go with little of the fan ##fare that acc ##omp ##anies many of his foreign travels .
but the two - day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration ' s policies in central america .
these critics object to mr . bush ' s participation in a meeting that includes nicaragua ##n president daniel ortega among the guests .
however , peace efforts by costa rican president oscar arias have n ' t always helped the country ' s cause in washington .
law ##makers in both houses support the higher level .
administration officials defend mr . bush ' s decision to make the trip .
` ` let me say there is a symbolic component to this trip , ' ' secretary of state james baker told reporters wednesday .
` ` there wo n ' t be any formal resolutions or com ##mun ##iques , i do n ' t think .
but we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many , many very important issues .
a brief ` ` executive summary ' ' was issued last april , and attracted some , but not much , attention .
more - detailed reports followed , and attracted even less notice .
i suspect i may be one of the few people to have read them all .
the sixth and last report now is out , and it puts the effort in perspective .
it ' s little less than a cry for help from those who make the costly show possible .
the previous five reports were mainly statistical , but clear enough in outline .
but even those numbers do n ' t describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words .
of the almost 3 , 000 athletes surveyed , 1 , 240 took the time to respond .
football is the no . 1 thing here ' ' .
- - ` ` being a student - athlete at college is a lot different from high school .
first , the sport you play is no longer a game - - it becomes a job .
your coaches demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing to take the time to watch you progress .
your interest is not taken to heart because people only care about your performance ' ' .
- - ` ` the coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes - - not treat us like pieces of meat .
they always say to get a degree first , but they do n ' t allow us time or to skip practice to study for a test .
they just want to get their job done at any cost to the athlete ' ' .
- - ` ` the pressure put on us to win at all times has resulted in physical violence , such as punching and slapping by coaches .
some days the coaches make you feel as though you are part of a large herd of animals .
in other words , they treat you like a piece of meat ' ' .
- - ` ` playing intercollegiate sports does n ' t give you a lot of time to spend with others .
we are almost left out of - lc ##b - campus - rc ##b - social activities .
this mostly happens because we go from football in the fall to lifting in the winter to football again in the spring ' ' .
- - ` ` you talk about free time - - . what free time ?
there is no recovery period - - it ' s go , go , go .
with our schedule , it ' s hard to sleep well knowing what is going to happen the next day ' ' .
- - ` ` physical exhaustion and depression are common in my life and in some of my teammates ' lives ' ' .
- - ` ` more often than not , college athletes go through college never really experiencing collegiate life to the full ##est .
there have been rumbling ##s that , at long last , changes may be in the works .
the key word in that paragraph , though , is ` ` may . ' '
but the ` ` real world ' ' also includes the unpleasant truth that colleges are cheating the athletes they have woo ##ed and won .
if they wo n ' t change their ways voluntarily , maybe somebody bigger - - congress - - should make them .
they want late - night shuttle ##s to the biology labs .

environmental concerns are beginning to have as much influence in oil - industry spending plans as the price of crude does .
over the years , the world ' s stream of oil has been growing heavier .
so the scramble is on for lighter crude ##s globally , and for natural gas in the u . s . .
recently saudi arabia and venezuela , traditional heavy - crude producers , have boasted of new finds of light , low - sulfur oil by their national oil companies .
venezuela has also ear ##mark ##ed $ 200 million in new money for light - crude exploration .
and some oil companies are trying to lock in future supplies .
ag ##ip already has an oil stake in libya .
both countries produce high - quality , low - sulfur crude ##s especially suited to making high - oct ##ane motor fuel at minimum refining cost .
he made a special trip to examine u . s . environmental trends because they are often followed in europe .
en ##i needs to know what ' s coming as it prepares to spend some $ 1 . 3 billion on upgrading its ref ##iner ##ies , he says .
it will go for work ranging from refinery modification to changes in the distribution system , including the way service stations pump fuel into cars .
in the u . s . , the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves .
alaska ' s arctic national wildlife refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil .
until the tanker spill , big oil was slowly convincing authorities it could safely produce from such places .
now the wildlife refuge has been closed to the industry , possibly for years .
similarly , a group of companies led by che ##vron corp . has been unable to pump oil found off the california coast in the early 1980s .

the proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of pere ##st ##roi ##ka , mikhail go ##rba ##chev ' s restructuring of the economy .
they also address such taboo subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation , and recommend ways to soft ##en the social consequences .
` ` it ' s clearly a manifesto for the next stage of pere ##st ##roi ##ka , ' ' said one analyst .
the economic ideas in the document are much bold ##er than current policies .
the document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month , and will probably be presented to the soviet parliament for consideration this year .
instead , they map out a strategy in several phases from now until 1995 .
most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on bel ##ea ##gue ##red soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest .
the key steps advocated include : - - property .
rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned .
emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country ' s financial crisis , notably its $ 200 billion budget deficit .
similar steps would be taken to liquid ##ate un ##pro ##fi ##table state and collective farms by the end of 1991 .
a unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly .
a genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid , centralized system .
departing from decades of soviet dog ##ma , the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment .
to cushion the blows , the government would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits .
the entire system of centrally set prices would be overhaul ##ed , and free - market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade .
inflation - adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly do n ' t suffer und ##ul ##y .
the current liberal ##ization and decent ##ral ##ization of foreign trade would be taken much further .
soviet companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad .
foreigners would receive greater incentives to invest in the u . s . s . r .
alongside the current non - convertible rub ##le , a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other western cu ##rre ##ncies .
a domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation ' s banking system .
i ' ll admit there ' s nothing wrong that i ever do find , but it ' s nice when people say i appear mechanically inclined .

but one recent day , they became much closer .
like many sports buff ##s , mr . eng ##el ##ken has turned cy ##nic .
some 34 , 320 fans jammed the stands , and shouted at the top of their lungs .
the playoff series had ri ##vet ##ed the 12 - year - old giants fan .
the rest , as they say , is history .
mr . thomson , a tall , scottish - born , right - hand hitter , stepped into the batter ' s box .
` ` thomson took a called strike , ' ' mr . eng ##el ##ken recounts .
the tension mounted as ralph bran ##ca , again on the mound , stared down the batter .
he wound up and let loose a fast ##ball .
` ` giants fans went into eu ##ph ##oria , ' ' says mr . eng ##el ##ken .

the couple ' s first dog , homer , was named after the great event , though un ##wi ##tting friends assumed he was the namesake of the poet .
martha was pleased , but nowhere near as much as mr . eng ##el ##ken .
` ` what could have been better ? ' ' asks mr . eng ##el ##ken .
betsy eng ##el ##ken asked the same question earlier this year , when her husband was about to turn 50 .
mrs . eng ##el ##ken had scheduled a stop on the new jersey turnpike to , she told her husband , pick up some papers for a neighbor .
the papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone booths just off exit 10 .
` ` it sounded like something out of ian fleming , ' ' mr . eng ##el ##ken recalls .
at the appointed exit , the family pulled over , and mrs . eng ##el ##ken went to get her papers .
mr . eng ##el ##ken turned off the motor and rolled down the window .
in a matter of minutes , she was back , with a tall , silver - haired man in tow .
she crouched down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite nickname :
` ` bertie , ' ' she said , ` ` happy 50th birthday .
` ` and there he was , ' ' recalls mr . eng ##el ##ken .
` ` the hero of my youth , the one person in history i ' d most like to meet .
keep your thomas jefferson ##s , or st . augustine ##s or michelangelo ##s ; i ' d take baseball ' s flying sc ##ot without hesitation . ' '
` ` i thought it was in the upper deck , ' ' said bobby thomson , now 66 years old .
` ` i never thought it would become so moment ##ous , ' ' bobby remarked .
mr . eng ##el ##ken , says his wife , ` ` was overwhelmed by the whole thing .
it was worth it , just for the look on albert ' s face . ' '
his hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatic ##ally called ralph bran ##ca ` ` a very fine pitcher . ' '
but his fans , to his constant amazement , never let him forget the famous four - bag ##ger .
his mail regularly recalls ` ` my one event , ' ' and has been growing in recent years .
in response to the letters , mr . thomson usually sends an auto ##graph ##ed photo with a polite note , and rarely arrange ##s a rendezvous .
but when betsy eng ##el ##ken wrote him , saying she could stop near his new jersey home , it seemed different .
` ` what a good feeling it would be for me to do that , ' ' he says he thought .
` ` on the way home , ' ' his notes recall , ` ` it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south .
` ` take heart , sports fans , ' ' he wrote .
you might not find one in the ` jurisprudence ' column .
you might meet up with him at that bank of telephone booths just off exit 10 of the new jersey turnpike .
south ##am inc . said its un ##pro ##fi ##table weekly newspaper , the financial times of canada , is up for sale .
descendants of the south ##am family hold an additional 22 . 6 % stake in the toronto - based company , canada ' s largest newspaper publisher .
south ##am said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas .
the financial times of canada has no links to the british daily newspaper , the financial times .
the company had a tax credit of $ 1 . 4 million .
in the year - earlier quarter , the tax credit was $ 3 . 3 million .
sales rose 8 % to $ 36 ##8 . 5 million from $ 340 . 7 million .
operating profit in the company ' s ab ##ras ##ives segment rose 16 % while operating profit in the engineering materials segment rose 2 % .
norton and texas eastern had each held a 50 % stake in eastman in a joint venture .
norton announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or part of eastman christensen .
sales rose 8 % to $ 1 . 15 billion from $ 1 . 06 billion .
by this month , it had more than doubled .
now the 33 - year - old house ##wife , whose husband earn ##s a modest salary as an assistant professor of economics , is saving harder than ever .
` ` i am determined to get an apartment in three years , ' ' she says .
` ` it ' s all i think about or talk about . ' '
for the parks and millions of other young koreans , the long - cher ##ished dream of home ownership has become a cruel illusion .
for the government , it has become a highly volatile political issue .
last may , a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem .
during the past 15 years , the report showed , housing prices increased nearly five ##fold .
the report laid the blame on spec ##ulator ##s , who it said had pushed land prices up nine ##fold .
the result is that those rich enough to own any real estate at all have boosted their holdings substantially .
for those with no holdings , the prospects of buying a home are ever slim ##mer .
meanwhile , the government ' s land bureau reports that only about a third of korean families own their own homes .
former national assembly ##man hong sa - du ##k , now a radio commentator , says the problem is into ##ler ##able for many people .
` ` i ' m afraid of a popular revolt if this situation is n ' t corrected , ' ' he adds .
president ro ##h tae woo ' s administration has been studying the real - estate crisis for the past year with an eye to partial land redistribution .
last week , the government took three bills to the national assembly .
the proposed legislation is aimed at rec ##tify ##ing some of the in ##e ##qui ##ties in the current land - ownership system .
the government will penal ##ize offenders , but wo n ' t con ##fi ##sca ##te property .
- - a tax of between 3 % and 6 % on property holdings that exceed the governments ##et ceiling .
the government defines excessive profits as those above the average realized for other similar - sized properties in an area .
- - grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect .
some want lower limits on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots .
but others , large landowners , real - estate developers and business leaders , say the government ' s proposals are into ##ler ##able .
led by the federation of korean industries , the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties .
government officials who are urging real - estate reforms bal ##k at the arguments of business leaders and cha ##fe at their pressure .
but , he adds , the constitution em ##power ##s the government to impose some controls , to mit ##igate the shortage of land .
mr . lee estimates that about 10 , 000 property spec ##ulator ##s are operating in south korea .
under those measures , financial institutions would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations .
banks , investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to 50 % of their capital - - currently the proportion is 75 % .
the maximum allow ##able property holdings for insurance companies would be reduced to 10 % of their total asset value , down from 15 % currently .
but mrs . park acknowledges that even if the policies work to slow or stop speculation , apartment prices are unlikely to go down .
at best , she realizes , they will rise more slowly - - more slowly , she hopes , than her family ' s income .
the maker of specialty chemicals has about 5 . 9 million shares outstanding .
the company said the move recognizes its strong financial position .
in national over - the - counter trading yesterday , cam ##bre ##x shares rose 50 cents to close at $ 13 a share .
this would be the department ' s first suit challenging a local zoning ordinance under 1988 amendments to the fair housing act .
under those amendments , which took effect in march of this year , the federal government can intervene in private housing - discrimination lawsuits .
the ordinance , in moon township , prohibits locating a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility .
the private suit was brought by three mentally re ##tar ##ded people who live in a group home in moon .
he said the ordinance also will benefit the mentally re ##tar ##ded .
` ` our intent is to spread them out ' ' to ins ##ure they are well integrated into the community , he said .
then , when it would have been easier to resist them , nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug mafia ##s three years ago .
the most ruthless dictatorship ##s have not ce ##nsor ##ed their press more brutally than the drug mafia ##s ce ##nsor colombia ' s .
in the past 10 years about 50 journalists have been silenced forever , murdered .
and only last week the newspaper vanguard ##ia liberal in the city of bu ##car ##aman ##ga was bombed , and its installations destroyed .
journalists and their families are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution outlets .
distribution centers are bombed , and ad ##vert ##iser ##s are intimidated .
the solidarity of the un ##cens ##ored media world - wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive .
the american people and their government also woke up too late to the menace drugs posed to the moral structure of their country .
even now , the american attack upon this tremendous problem is tim ##id in relation to the magnitude of the threat .
colombia alone - - its government , its people , its newspapers - - does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully .
all drug - consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs .
the u . s . , as the major drug consumer , should lead this joint effort .
reduction , if not the total ce ##ssa ##tion , of drug consumption is the requirement for victory .
much is being done in colombia to fight the drug cartel mafia .
luxurious homes and ranch ##es have been raided by the military authorities , and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized .
more than 300 planes and helicopters have been imp ##ounded at airports , and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated .
the military has also captured enormous arsenal ##s of powerful and sophisticated weapons , explosives and other war - like mater ##iel .
there has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money .
drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars , airplanes , launches and nightclub ##s where drugs are consumed .
but most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside colombia .
in fact , the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle .
what is of much more importance to the colombian economy than the supposed benefits of lau ##nder ##ed drug money is higher prices for colombia ' s legitimate products .
market conditions point to even lower prices next year .
the 27 - year - old coffee cartel had to be formally dissolved this summer .
as a result , colombia will earn $ 500 million less from its coffee this year than last .
our coffee grow ##ers face reductions in their income , and this te ##mpt ##s them to con ##tem ##plate sub ##stituting coca crops for coffee .
u . s . interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important colombian export - - cut flowers - - into the american market .
a just price and an open market for what colombian produces and exports should be the policy of the u . s . .
each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible sc ##our ##ge .
a crusade of no to the consumption of drugs is imperative .
mr . can ##o is president of el es ##pe ##cta ##dor , a newspaper founded by his grandfather .
it has more drug users than boston has people .
thirty - four thousand of its children live in foster homes , while 50 , 000 residents have no homes at all .
its tax base is shrinking , a $ 1 billion budget deficit lo ##oms , and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year .
running the nation ' s largest and most or ##nery city may be no treat , but at least mr . din ##kins knows what to expect from it .
as the campaign hits the home stretch , however , voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him .
after 25 years in city politics , david din ##kins remains an enigma .
while he is widely described as a man with deep convictions , he has few major political programs that he can call his own .
asked about his greatest achievement in public life , he first speaks about the quality of his staff .
now , as election day near ##s , even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the mayoral ##ty on nov . 7 .
they wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies , including union leaders and political cr ##oni ##es who may seek a place at the trough .
they wonder whether he has the economic know - how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis , and they wonder who will be advising him .
` ` a lot of people think i will give away the store , but i can assure you i will not , ' ' he says .
` ` i am aware we have real budget ##ary problems . ' '
the city is full of aging bridges , water main ##s and roadway ##s that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair .
renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly .
but city officials say tax revenues are la ##gging .
and after a decade of explosive job growth on wall street , a period of contraction is under way .
mr . koch already has announced he will drop 3 , 200 jobs from the city payroll , but that wo n ' t be enough .
` ` he is going to face a mess , ' ' says city council president andrew stein .
by and large , mr . din ##kins has fines ##sed the touch ##y question of whose ox he would gore .
` ` it is a feel - good candidacy . ' '
no doubt , mr . din ##kins has been a calming influence .
he has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke .
these campaign problems have echoed difficulties mr . din ##kins has run into before .
` ` i always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow , ' ' he said at the time .

the debt rose further in 1977 when mr . sutton resigned his position as manhattan borough president to run for mayor .
but the guy is so personally decent , people tend to forget that . ' '
mr . din ##kins lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in 1985 .
often , mr . din ##kins ' s pro ##cr ##ast ##ination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out , critics claim .
says one city official : ` ` everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal .
he would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster . ' '
` ` we did n ' t rubber - stamp everything that came to us , ' ' mr . lynch says .
on some occasions when mr . din ##kins has discussed the issues during the campaign , he has run into a familiar kind of trouble .
some supporters were stunned this summer when mr . din ##kins suggested weakening the law forbid ##ding public employees to go on strike .
while his public statements have at times been confusing , mr . din ##kins ' s position papers have more consistently reflected anti - development sentiment .
he favors a form of commercial rent control , which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city .
in the midst of a labor shortage , he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring new york city residents .
with an un ##train ##ed local labor pool , many experts believe , that policy could drive businesses from the city .
many economic - development officials say the koch administration ' s aggressive approach helped save 5 , 000 chase manhattan bank jobs from moving across the hudson .
but mr . din ##kins ' s economic plank ##s do n ' t seem to bother the business community , where he draws significant support .
the key man seems to be the campaign manager , mr . lynch .
if she remains influential with mr . din ##kins , as some suggest she will , his mayoral ##ty may take on a more anti - development flavor .
some business leaders and others also believe that mr . din ##kins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background .
as a republican in an overwhelmingly democratic city , mr . gi ##ulia ##ni has an inherent handicap .
as a first - time candidate , he has been slow to learn the nu ##ances of new york city pol ##itic ##king .
` ` the bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy , ' ' says malcolm ho ##en ##lein , a jewish community leader .
` ` in the end , i think david will be judged for being david .
toni johnson pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a state ##ly victorian home .
a deep trench now runs along its north wall , exposed when the house lurched two feet off its foundation during last week ' s earthquake .
the chimney is a pile of bricks on the front lawn .
the remainder of the house leans pre ##car ##iously against a sturdy oak tree .
some of the funds will used to demo ##lish unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction .
many adjust ##ers are authorized to write checks for amounts up to $ 100 , 000 on the spot .
they do n ' t flinch at writing them .
the victorian house that ms . johnson is inspecting has been deemed unsafe by town officials .
but she asks a work ##man to ##ting the bricks from the lawn to give her a boost through an open first - floor window .
she snaps photos of the buckled floors and the plaster that has fallen away from the walls .
while she works inside , a tenant returns with several friends to collect furniture and clothing .
one of the friends sweeps broken dishes and shattered glass from a counter ##top and starts to pack what can be salvage ##d from the kitchen .
others grab books , records , photo albums , sofa ##s and chairs , working frantically in the fear that an after ##sho ##ck will jolt the house again .
the owners , william and mar ##gie ham ##mack , are luck ##ier than many others .
a few years ago , mrs . ham ##mack insisted on buying earthquake insurance for this house , which had been converted into apartments .
only about 20 % of california home and business owners carried earthquake coverage .
the ham ##mack ##s ' own home , also in los ga ##tos , suffered comparatively minor damage .
` ` it really brings you down to a human level , ' ' she says .
` ` it ' s hard to accept all the suffering people are going through , but you have to .
if you do n ' t , you ca n ' t do your job . ' '
for ae ##t ##na and other ins ##urer ##s , the san francisco earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched .
most companies still are trying to sort through the wreckage caused by hurricane hugo in the carolina ##s last month .
ae ##t ##na , which has nearly 3 , 000 adjust ##ers , had deployed about 750 of them in charlotte , columbia , and charleston .
adjust ##ers who had been working on the east coast say the ins ##urer will still be processing claims from that storm through december .
it could take six to nine months to handle the earthquake - related claims .
even so , few had ever dealt with an earthquake .
some adjust ##ers , like alan singer of san diego , had been working in charleston for nearly four weeks .
he returned home last thursday , packed a bag with fresh clothes and reported for duty friday in walnut creek .
offices were set up in san francisco and san jose .
` ` the secret to being a good adjust ##er is counting , ' ' says gerard ##o rodriguez , an ae ##t ##na adjust ##er from santa ana .
` ` you have to count everything . ' '
adjust ##ers must count the number of bathrooms , bal ##con ##ies , fireplace ##s , chimneys , microwave ##s and dish ##wash ##ers .
he also is working with a real - estate agent to help find them an apartment to rent while their home is being built .
many of the adjust ##ers employed by ae ##t ##na and other ins ##urer ##s have some experience with construction work or carp ##ent ##ry .
four years ago , she was managing a film - processing shop and was totally bored .
a friend mentioned that she might want to look into a position at ae ##t ##na , if she was interested in a job that would constantly challenge her .
she signed up , starting as an ` ` inside ' ' adjust ##er , who settles minor claims and does a lot of work by phone .
a year later , she moved to the commercial property claims division .
that was followed by three months at the ae ##t ##na institute in hartford , where she was immersed in learning how to read and interpret policies .
her new line of work has some per ##ils .
recently , a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old victorian house torch ##ed by an arson ##ist .
as ms . johnson stands outside the ham ##mack house after winding up her chores there , the house begins to cr ##eak and sway .
it is an after ##sho ##ck , one of about 2 , 000 since the earthquake , and it makes her uneasy .
during her second meeting with the ham ##mack ##s , ms . johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers .
they would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor , but wonder if it ' s safe to venture inside .
ms . johnson tells them that , if the appliances ca n ' t be salvage ##d , their policy covers the replacement cost .
mr . ham ##mack is eager to know what ae ##t ##na will pay for the house , which has to come down .
` ` when will i get that check for a million dollars ? ' ' he jokes .
the adjust ##er had n ' t completed all the calculations , but says : ` ` we ' re talking policy limits . ' '
in this case , that ' s about $ 250 , 000 .
` ` we can lose money on this , ' ' he says .
so , many california ##ns believe they can get by without it .
` ` i always knew that the ` big one ' was coming , but not during my lifetime , ' ' she says .
now she says she ' s thinking of contact ##ing her own insurance agent .
for ms . johnson , dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience .
she lives in oakland , a community hit hard by the earthquake .
she did n ' t have hot water for five days .
her sister , cynthia , wishes toni had a different job .
` ` we worry about her out there , ' ' cynthia says .
last sunday , ms . johnson finally got a chance to water her plants , but stopped abruptly .
she has n ' t played any music since the earthquake hit , out of respect for those who died on interstate 880 where the roadway collapsed .
alfred si ##kes , the new fcc chairman , championed der ##eg ##ulation of at & t at his last job as head of a commerce department telecommunications agency .
the fcc took three specific actions regarding at & t .
the agency said that because mc ##i ' s offer had expired at & t could n ' t continue to offer its discount plan .
the fcc ` ` did n ' t say i could n ' t do it again , ' ' he said .
richard fires ##tone , chief of the fcc ' s common - carrier bureau , said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year .
at & t app ##lau ##ded the fcc ' s actions .
united telecommunications inc . ' s us sprint unit said it was ` ` obviously disappointed ' ' with the fcc decision on tariff 12 .
us sprint said was it will petition the fcc decision in federal court .
` ` we believe that the court will find it unlawful , ' ' said a us sprint spokesman .
separately , at & t filed a counters ##uit against mc ##i accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly ` ` false and dec ##eptive ' ' advertising .
the at & t action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight .
earlier this month , mc ##i sued at & t in federal district court , claiming that at & t ' s ads are false .
at & t assembled three of its top executives in washington , all visibly angry , to try to ref ##ute mc ##i ' s charges .

it made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds .
interviews with three major fund groups - - fidelity investments , vanguard group inc . and t . rowe price associates inc . - - confirm the trend .
some fund managers say negative publicity has ex ##ace ##rba ##ted investors ' concern about recent declines in junk - bond prices .
the withdrawal ##s could spell trouble for the $ 200 billion junk market .
if the heavy out ##flow ##s continue , fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead .
such selling could er ##ode prices of high - yield junk bonds , already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems .
mutual fund groups have n ' t lost control of much of the outgoing money , says louis harvey , dal ##bar ' s president .
mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts , and to a lesser extent , government - bond funds .
so the impact on the $ 950 billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight .
but tremor ##s are likely in the junk - bond market , which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years .
mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk , accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high - yield , high - risk market .
the 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $ 32 billion .
other funds hold a sm ##atter ##ing of junk bonds , too .
the $ 1 . 5 billion fidelity high income fund has had a net out ##flow of about $ 150 million in the past two months .
about $ 60 million streamed out last week alone , double the level of the week following last month ' s camp ##eau corp . credit squeeze .
still , two - thirds of the out ##flow has been steered into other vanguard portfolio ##s , says brian matt ##es , a vice president .
the fund now holds a cash position of about 15 % .
at the $ 93 ##2 million t . rowe price high yield fund , investors yanked out about $ 182 million in the past two months .
` ` the last two months have been the whole ball game , ' ' says steven nor ##witz , a vice president .
junk - fund holders have barely broken even this year , as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices .
that ' s even less than the 4 . 35 % total return of the merrill lynch high - yield index .
people who remain in junk funds now could get hit again , some analysts and fund specialists say .
funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less - credit ##worthy borrow ##ers .
and then , asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far .
mr . lawson ' s resignation shocked many analysts , despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and prime minister margaret thatcher .
` ` the resignation came as a great surprise . ' '
` ` the market was caught totally the wrong way . . . .
everyone was extremely long on sterling , ' ' mr . beale said .
sterling was quoted at $ 1 . 57 ##65 , sharply down from $ 1 . 61 ##45 late wednesday .
also announcing his resignation thursday was alan walters , mrs . thatcher ' s economic adviser and mr . lawson ' s nemesis .
u . s . g ##np rose at an annual rate of 2 . 5 % in the third quarter .
in europe , the dollar ended lower in dull trading .
the market closed prior to mr . lawson ' s announcement .
on the commodity exchange in new york , gold for current delivery rose $ 3 . 40 to $ 37 ##2 . 50 an ounce in heavy trading .
in early trading in hong kong friday , gold was quoted at $ 370 . 85 an ounce .
the following issues were recently filed with the securities and exchange commission :
an ##he ##user - busch co ##s . , shelf offering of $ 57 ##5 million of debt securities .
he once used that line in a closed - door meeting on panama , meaning do n ' t shrink from taking action against manuel nor ##ieg ##a .
george bush disclosed the policy last week by reading it to go ##p senators , perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the panama fia ##sco to congress .
but the broader truth is more complicated - - and dismay ##ing .
the policy was contained in an exchange of letters last october between the senate intelligence committee and the cia and national security council .
staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the u . s . could not do to ou ##st the panama ##nian thug .
they simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassination ##s really meant .
it ' s ironic that david bore ##n should be in the center of this mir ##e .
a former oklahoma governor , he ' s a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy .
` ` they allowed this country to be credible .
i really want to see that happen again . ' '
if this were 1949 , mr . bore ##n might even succeed .
last july , his committee rejected a reagan administration plan to support a coup in panama .
ohio democrat howard metz ##en ##baum refused to support any plan that might get people hurt , a charming notion for a great power .
maine republican william cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban .
by october , when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal , even the administration was agreeing little should be done .
mr . bore ##n does n ' t think all this influenced the failed coup this month , but he does con ##cede that congress has made mistakes .
but even mr . bore ##n defend ##s congressional oversight .
writing in the harvard international review , he says that his committee approve ##s covert operations only when there ' s a ` ` consensus . ' '
` ` it does n ' t mean unanimous , ' ' he insists , though he implies it means a bi ##partisan majority .
` ` the sustainability of u . s . foreign policy is essential , ' ' he explains .
mr . bore ##n is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions .
van ##den ##berg and ray ##burn were wise enough to leave specific operations to presidents ; modern senators , mr . bore ##n notwithstanding , are less modest .
the result is that the senate committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action .
` ` i would n ' t say it ' s quite a veto , ' ' mr . bore ##n dem ##urs .
but would n ' t a president who acted despite senate objections be taking grave political risks ?
` ` he would , ' ' agrees the chairman .
` ` but that is something the president ought to know before he goes ahead . ' '
mr . bore ##n even spies a silver lining .
he figures the episode will help ` ` clarify any am ##bi ##gui ##ties ' ' between the committee and administration .
more broadly , mr . bore ##n hopes that panama will shock washington out of its fear of using military power .
` ` maybe this will jolt us out of the post - vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force , ' ' he says .
maybe - - if every senator shared the principles of mr . bore ##n .
but panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd grid ##lock .
the lawyers are now in charge of our national security .
in panama , the u . s . interests at stake were happily minor ; the only people killed were foreigners ha ##ples ##s enough to trust american will .
americans may not be so lucky the next time .

at stake are almost 10 , 000 jobs in an industry that has been the main ##sta ##y of finland ' s post - war economic revival .
shipbuilding became a point of pride as finnish shipyard ##s remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over europe .
the second ship is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 and the third in fall 1991 .
all the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency , even though it ' s not clear whether they will actually be built .
bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments , ship ##pers will counter with a hail of lawsuits .
state loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy .
in that case , international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company ' s debt carried implicit state guarantees .
moreover , state - owned finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets , bankers say .
in august , the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard .
under the rescue plan , wa ##ert ##sil ##ae sold 51 % of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds .
the government , in turn , guaranteed financing to complete the order back ##log and took control of the board .
government officials were expected to combine wa ##ert ##sil ##ae marine with two other struggling firms , and thus ensure finland ' s survival as a shipbuilding nation .
senior ministry officials huddled with creditors during the week in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep wa ##ert ##sil ##ae marine operating .
the talks may drag on for weeks before any concrete result is announced , people familiar with them said .

mr . ant ##ar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in newark by the securities and exchange commission .

the stock market correction of oct . 13 , 1989 , was a grim reminder of the oct . 19 , 1987 market collapse .
since , like earthquakes , stock market disturbances will always be with us , it is pr ##ude ##nt to take all possible precautions against another such market collapse .
in general , markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances .
but there are times when they seize up , and panic ##ky sellers can not find buyers .
that ' s just what happened in the october 1987 crash .
these failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages : uncertainty extracted an extra risk premium and margin - calls triggered additional selling pressures .
the situation was like that of a skier who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected bump on the slope .
unable to stop his accelerating descent , he crashes .
it ' s doubtful , though , whether circuit breakers do any real good .
in the additional time they provide even more order im ##balance ##s might pile up , as would - be sellers finally get their broker on the phone .
instead , an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market : the federal reserve .
the availability of timely assistance - - of a backs ##top - - can help markets retain their res ##ili ##ence .
the fed already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent disorder ##ly conditions in foreign - exchange markets .
the fed has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities .
the stock market is the only major market without a market - maker of un ##chal ##len ##ged liquid ##ity or a buyer of last resort .
this does not mean that the federal reserve does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market .
in 1987 , it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window .
it lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to broker ##age houses .
they , in turn , lent money to their customers - - who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares .
the fed also has the power to set margin requirements .
but would n ' t it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly ?
the stock market is certainly not too big for the fed to handle .
the foreign - exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger .
daily trading volume in the new york foreign exchange market is $ 130 billion .
the daily volume for treasury securities is about $ 110 billion .
the $ 13 billion the fed injected into the money markets after the 1987 crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day .
more carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action .
and taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply , such as happened in october 1987 .
the fed ' s stock market role ought not to be very ambitious .
it should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets - - not to prop up the dow jones or new york stock exchange averages at a particular level .
the fed should guard against systemic risk , but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks .
it would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell ibm or general motors shares .
instead , the fed could buy the broad market composite ##s in the futures market .
the increased demand would normal ##ize trading and stabilize prices .
stab ##ili ##zing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market .
the fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the sy ##mpt ##om - - the liquid ##ity of the banks .
disorder ##ly market conditions could be observed quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in the 1960s and 1970s .
but since the member countries of the international monetary fund agreed to the ` ` guidelines to floating ' ' in 1974 , such difficulties have been avoided .
i can not recall any disorder in currency markets since the 1974 guidelines were adopted .
thus , the mere existence of a market - stab ##ili ##zing agency helps to avoid panic in emergencies .
the old saying advises : ` ` if it ai n ' t broke , do n ' t fix it . ' '
but this could be a case where we all might go broke if it is n ' t fixed .

his remarks were distributed to the press before chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced his resignation last evening .
bank of england officials said the central bank had no comment on mr . lawson ' s resignation .
in other comments , he said takeover ##s may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy .
` ` a similar result could sometimes be achieved , at less cost , by changing management ##s , ' ' he said .
on friday , intel began not ##ifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations .
he ##wl ##ett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 48 ##6 chip early next year .
` ` these bugs do n ' t affect our schedule at all , ' ' he said .
likewise , as ##t research inc . and sun micro ##systems inc . said the bugs wo n ' t delay their development of 48 ##6 - based machines .
` ` we have n ' t modified our schedules in any way , ' ' said a sun spokesman .
to switch to another vendor ' s chips , ` ` would definitely not be an option , ' ' he said .
most of com ##pa ##q ' s decline is being attributed to a third - quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations .
intel said it had corrected the problems and would start producing bug ##less chips next week .
` ` we should not be seeing any more , ' ' said bill rash , intel ' s director for the 48 ##6 chip .
` ` these er ##rata do not affect business programs , ' ' he said .
sun , he ##wl ##ett - packard and others say intel is n ' t wholly to blame for the s ##na ##fu .
` ` you can do that but you ' re taking a risk .
those companies are paying the price for taking the risk . ' '
an ibm spoke ##sw ##oman said the company told customers monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product .
` ` we do n ' t look at this as a major problem for us , ' ' she said .
com ##pa ##q , which said it discovered the bugs , still plans to announce new 48 ##6 products on nov . 6 .
because of the g ##lit ##ch , however , the company said it does n ' t know when its machine will be commercially available .
that ' s a break from com ##pa ##q tradition , because the company does n ' t announce products until they ' re actually at the dealers .
the problem is being ball ##y ##ho ##oed , experts say , because the 48 ##6 is intel ' s future flagship .
intel clocks the chip ' s speed at 15 million instructions per second , or mi ##ps .
that ' s four times as fast as the 38 ##6 .
but while the chip ' s speed in processing power is dazzling , it ' s real strength lies in its software inheritance .
that ' s what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs .
of the big computer makers , only apple computer co . bases its machines on motorola chips instead .
` ` it ' s going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years .
this bug is not going to have any affect on that at all . ' '

canadian production of market pulp rose 1 % in september from a year earlier as the industry operated at 87 % of capacity .
market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products .
the statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill .
canada is the world ' s largest producer of market pulp .
the september 87 % operating rate compared with a rate of 101 % in august but was unchanged from a year earlier .
the price also includes assumption of about $ 1 . 4 billion in debt .
the completion of the merger agreement follows months of twists and turns .
a few days later , american medical announced sharply lower earnings , taking charges of $ 24 million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases .
it also was considering a restructuring to help boost the stock price .
a group including several members of the the bass family of texas urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder value .
the following month , the company put itself up for sale .
he indicated that some assets might be sold off to service the debt .
american medical accepted the offer , meanwhile indicating it had heard from two other suit ##ors .

treasury secretary nicholas brady said that congress should grant the securities and exchange commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis .
he added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency .
separately , mr . brady said he asked the working group on financial markets to determine whether futures margins are too low .
he noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the 1987 crash .
` ` this raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate , ' ' mr . brady said .
margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract .
margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market vol ##ati ##lity .
margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash oct . 19 , 1987 .
before taking any action , he advised the panel to ` ` see what the market has produced as a cure . ' '
but he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds .
` ` i do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time , ' ' he said .
but mr . brady endorsed the market - revision bill that both houses of congress will try to push through this session .
mr . brady and senators agreed to have their staff ##s meet within the next week to start fine - tuning the bill .
the senate agriculture committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far - reaching bill that would become the futures trading practices act of 1989 .
the proposed legislation has a lau ##dable goal : to assure the integrity of the u . s . futures markets .
however , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve .
many aspects of the bill are sal ##uta ##ry , providing appropriate public safeguard ##s that can and should be instituted throughout the industry .
the new york futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill .
we would be delighted to have such a system in place today .
but is it realistic for congress to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been subjected to feasibility studies ?
what if the system does n ' t work ?
what if the only system that does work is so expensive that , at best , only the largest exchanges can afford it ?
cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets .
the u . s . futures exchanges compete world - wide as never before .
today , trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from u . s . markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard .
all foreign markets are aggressively court ##ing u . s . business .
in fact , several london markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts .
the u . s . exchanges need both market integrity and cost - efficiency ; long - term growth depends on it .
the senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading .
other provisions have a more subtle , but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of u . s . exchanges .
these include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include pun ##itive damages .
in addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members , these measures could have other , far - reaching rep ##er ##cus ##sions .
one section of the bill would make all commodity broker ##age firms and floor broker ##s liable for damages without will ##ful misconduct .
nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or ina ##d ##vert ##ent action a source of liability under similar circumstances .
it is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation .
another measure makes commodity broker ##age firms liable for violations committed by independent floor broker ##s who execute trades for them .
this un ##tri ##ed concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical pun ##itive damages .
this would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor broker ##s .
a consequence of their departure could be a serious dim ##in ##ution of market liquid ##ity .
in other words , regulation will occur through ina ##ction and happens ##tance , rather than through a normal del ##ibe ##rative procedure .
all u . s . futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision .
the markets are complex , as is the environment in which they function .
when problems surface , the temptation becomes strong to sum ##mar ##ily overhaul a market system that has served for more than 100 years .

these efforts wind up creating a market where the price vastly exceeds the cost .
with these incentives , demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it .

iv ##erson technology corp . was one of the fastest - growing small companies in america - - until last year .
the mclean , va . , company mod ##ifies computers to keep sensitive military data out of un ##fr ##ien ##dly hands .
but in 1988 , it ran into a buzz saw : a defense department spending freeze .
iv ##erson ' s earnings plunged 70 % to $ 1 . 2 million .
the troubles continued in this year ' s first half , when profit plunged 81 % to $ 302 , 000 .
iv ##erson technology is one of many small defense contractors besieged by the slow ##down in defense spending .
companies that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive .
for many companies , the instinct ##ive first response is to cut costs .
others are trying to find specialty defense work spared by the slow ##down or new niche ##s created by budget - cutting .
more ventures ##ome businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields .
er ##c international inc . , which provides professional and technical services to the military , is refining its defense niche , not retreating from it .
the company hit on a new strategy : if the defense department is so intent on saving money , why not make money off that trend ?
among the company ' s current efforts : repairing old parts at 25 % of the cost of replacing them .
un ##c also is selling new parts , if needed , directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor .
at as little as one - third of the government ' s cost , the company is running a program to train army helicopter pilots .
it is also taking over the maintenance of certain navy aircraft with 40 % fewer people than the military used .
in another approach , tiny iv ##erson technology is trying to resume its growth by bra ##ving the new world of commercial products .
donald iv ##erson , chairman , says he hopes the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets .
for now , he says , ` ` we ' re looking at buying some small companies with niche markets in the personal - computer business . ' '

quest ##ech inc . , falls church , va . , also has acquired some companies outside the military market .
moreover , it ' s trying to transfer its skill at designing military equipment to commercial ventures .
` ` it is an effort to branch out from the government , which is very difficult for a defense contractor . ' '

` ` it ' s evident we ' re entering a more competitive era , ' ' he says .
the company not only merged three military - electronics manufacturing operations , but also closed an unrelated plant that makes ordnance devices used in fighter planes and missiles .
the closing contributed to a $ 3 . 4 million loss in the fiscal first quarter ended july 31 - - its first quarterly loss since 1974 .

the labor department said wage increases in manufacturing industries continue to be smaller than those in other industries .
an enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed : he has made speaking filipino respectable .
radio programs and books have followed the daily television show .
now , she says , ` ` it ' s no longer an issue . ' '
the success of ` ` bat ##ib ##ot ' ' stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote filipino as a national language .
resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country ' s elite , who generally prefer english .
other opponents of filipino come from non - tag ##alo ##g regions .
- l ##rb - there are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country . - rr ##b -
what tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the philippines .
as a result , they often speak one language at home , another at school .
mrs . brown calls the modern - day cultural am ##bi ##vale ##nce to filipino a ` ` language schizophrenia . ' '
it does n ' t take much to provoke an intense debate .
but many proponents of filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling .
they believe the media , including ` ` bat ##ib ##ot , ' ' have played a crucial role .
according to chief script ##writer rene villa ##nu ##eva , ` ` bat ##ib ##ot ' ' does n ' t set out to advance the cause of filipino .
it is shown weekdays on two of the country ' s five networks .
periodically , there are threats that the program will fold .
` ` bat ##ib ##ot ' ' lacks the polish of ` ` sesame street . ' '
there are only two large puppets in the program : po ##ng pa ##gong and a monkey named ki ##ko mats ##ing .
but the production is the equal of any local program .
and the show ' s creativity makes up for any technological def ##iciencies .
the program is n ' t afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment .
not that the language war is won , even on ` ` bat ##ib ##ot . ' '

the dear ##born , mic ##h . , energy company stopped paying a divide ##nd in the third quarter of 1984 because of troubles at its midland nuclear plant .
the company estimates the offering price at between $ 14 and $ 16 a share .
the company said it expects to use the proceeds to repay certain bank debt and for general corporate purposes , including establishing new operating centers and possible acquisitions .
it will have 11 . 8 million shares outstanding after the offering , with health ##dy ##ne owning about 65 % of the total .
the move significantly expanded black & decker ' s product line , but also significantly increased its debt load .
the acquisition boosted black & decker ' s ratio of debt to total capital to more than 80 % .
company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than 50 % over the next 2 1 \ / 2 years .
the three units had combined 1988 sales of about $ 90 ##4 million .
the three units contributed about a third of em ##hart ' s total sales .
in addition , black & decker had said it would sell two other undisclosed em ##hart operations if it received the right price .
bo ##stic is one of the previously unnamed units , and the first of the five to be sold .
the company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects to announce agreements by the end of the year .
the five units generated sales of about $ 1 . 3 billion in 1988 , almost half of em ##hart ' s $ 2 . 3 billion revenue .
bo ##stic posted 1988 sales of $ 255 million .
the sales are an attempt to que ##ll investor concern about black & decker ' s increased debt burden from the em ##hart purchase .
the company ' s stock plunged when it first announced that it planned to acquire em ##hart .
the company maintains that it does n ' t expect em ##hart to contribute to earnings for about another 12 months .
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , black & decker closed at $ 19 . 75 yesterday , down 25 cents .
the company did n ' t announce the sale until after the close of the market .

yet another opportunity for president bush to respond , ` ` read my lips .

mr . gr ##ob ##stein ' s appointment formal ##izes a role he has been performing since the merger , a spoke ##sw ##oman said .
at the same time , he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying par ##iba ##s ' s bid .
for the moment , the sources said , he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a counter ##bid for par ##iba ##s .
mr . four ##nier said the exceptional gain would mean nearly twice as high a divide ##nd this year as last .
if holders avoid tender ##ing to par ##iba ##s , he added , they can expect strong divide ##nds again next year .
this time , however , some analysts think he could face a real battle .
mr . de cho ##let said mr . four ##nier ' s biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid .
one big question now is the likely role of mr . four ##nier ' s allies .
all ##ian ##z , for example , has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral .
par ##iba ##s is all ##ian ##z ' s lead french bank .
alternatively , it is to offer three par ##iba ##s shares for one navigation mix ##te share .

each note is being offered at $ 308 . 32 per $ 1 , 000 principal amount at maturity , representing an 8 % yield to maturity .
in addition , each note can be converted into blockbuster entertainment common stock at a rate of 13 . 85 ##1 shares per note .
merrill lynch capital markets inc . is the sole under ##writer for the offering .
the notes will have a principal amount of $ 300 million at maturity .
blockbuster shares closed yesterday at $ 18 . 75 , down $ 1 . 125 , in new york stock exchange trading .
in addition , corporations are now shoulder ##ing a bigger share of the tax burden , as the authors of the 1986 law hoped .

the bleak automotive results were offset by strong earnings from some non - automotive operations .
the last time all three companies reported north american automotive losses was in the recession year of 1982 .
yesterday ' s announcements helped spark a midday wave of program selling in the stock market .
the market ' s pe ##ssi ##mism reflects the gloom ##y outlook in detroit .
as japanese auto makers gained market share , the big three , with gm in the lead , slashed north american production and launched a retail discount ##ing blitz .
the price war peaked in the third quarter as big three factory discount ##s climbed to more than $ 1 , 000 a vehicle , according to industry officials .
gm probably had the ` ` heaviest incentives , ' ' said robert s . miller , chrysler ' s chief financial officer .
` ` we all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them . ' '
gm , ford and chrysler have already cut fourth - quarter u . s . output plans an estimated 15 % from 1988 levels .
if sales do n ' t pick up , the cuts will go deeper and incentives will sp ##rou ##t again .
ford , which has long boasted of its ability to weather a down ##turn , saw earnings take a beating .
nearly all the decline came in ford ' s u . s . automotive operations .
ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services .
still , mr . mcc ##am ##mon said ford expects the u . s . economy to weaken through the end of 1990 , causing weaker sales and production .
part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $ 500 million from the proposed sale of its rouge steel unit .
in the 1988 fourth quarter , ford had net of $ 1 . 16 billion , or $ 2 . 42 a share .
chrysler ' s operating profit fell to a scan ##t $ 22 million , or 10 cents a share , its lowest quarterly total in seven years .
sales were flat at $ 7 . 88 billion .
the results include record quarterly earnings of $ 76 million from chrysler financial corp .
a year earlier , chrysler ' s net was $ 113 million , or 50 cents a share .
consumers , he said , are bal ##king at higher prices on 1990 cars , especially after seeing the incentive - reduced prices on 1989 models .
sales rose 8 . 4 % to $ 27 . 95 billion from $ 25 . 78 billion .
heavy losses in north american auto operations sent gm ' s net tumbling to $ 51 ##6 . 9 million from a record $ 85 ##9 . 2 million .
detroit - based gm does n ' t issue separate quarterly earnings for the north american automotive business .
but analysts estimated that gm had a loss of as much as $ 300 million on domestic vehicle operations .
but gm ' s results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations .
in one breakdown , gm attributed half of its net to its two big technology units , electronic data systems corp . and gm hughes electronics corp .
meanwhile , gm said overseas auto operations are on track to exceed last year ' s record full - year net of $ 2 . 7 billion .
this cushion could come in handy if gm has to trim fourth - quarter north american production schedules more than the already scheduled 9 . 5 % .
it earned $ 3 . 46 billion on revenue of $ 91 . 21 billion in the 1988 nine months .
there are two versions of ` ` measure for measure ' ' on stage at the alley theater here .

in the play ' s major scenes mr . boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the shakespeare ##an dynamic .
at such moments mr . boyd makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior interpreter of shakespeare .
when , however , he decides to be modern , or more accurately , when he decides to be trend ##y , the results are far less satisfactory .
mr . boyd is of the directorial school that believes one must find modern parallels or metaphor ##s to make shakespeare accessible to today ' s audiences .
it ' s a valid approach , but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste .
loud rock music acc ##omp ##anies all the scene changes , even those in the convent .
when claudio is arrested , he is brought on stage nude except for the mana ##cles on his wrists and ankles .
the problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination .
despite the excess ##es , however , the score ##card for the production has many more plus ##es than minus ##es .
what ' s more , it represents an important step for the alley theater .
` ` measure for measure ' ' is mr . boyd ' s first directorial assignment as the theater ' s new artistic director .
he succeeded pat brown , who was fired by the alley board 18 months ago .
none of this backlash could change the fact that ms . brown ' s regime was remarkably und ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hed and un ##ima ##gina ##tive .
now the alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts .
but it is clear he is going to give it a shot .
democratic leaders have bottled up president bush ' s capital - gains tax cut in the senate and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely .
and neither democrats nor republicans are predicting that the capital - gains forces can produce enough votes .
` ` the 60 - vote requirement will be there and they do n ' t have the 60 votes , ' ' sen . mitchell said .
` ` they do n ' t have the votes to get it passed . ' '

previously he had said he would be able to find the re ##quisite 60 votes eventually .
democrats are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a fi ##lib ##ust ##er , or extended debate .
for a cl ##ot ##ure vote to stop the fi ##lib ##ust ##er , republicans must muster at least 60 votes .
yesterday , sen . pack ##wood acknowledged , ` ` we do n ' t have the votes for cl ##ot ##ure today . ' '
the republicans show no sign of re ##lent ##ing .
go ##p leaders continued to press for a vote on the amendment to the eastern europe aid measure .
and they threatened to try to amend any other revenue bill in the senate with the capital - gains provision .

the republicans contend that they can garner a majority in the 100 - member senate for a capital - gains tax cut .
they accuse the democrats of unfair ##ly using senate rules to erect a 60 - vote hurdle .
democrats counter that the republicans have often used the same rules to suit their own ends .
the two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the pack ##wood plan .
republicans countered that long - range revenue estimates were unreliable .
the pack ##wood proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held .

even though the u . s . also has supported canadian membership , it has n ' t been a washington priority .
` ` canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , ' ' mr . mu ##lr ##oney said recently .
some canadian political commentators have opposed canada ' s joining what they see as a u . s . - dominated organization .
canada , at times , could be an awkward o ##as partner for the u . s . if its united nations voting record is an indication .
in u . n . general assembly votes last year , canada voted the same as the u . s . only 63 % of the time .
france voted the same as the u . s . 76 % of the time , west germany 79 % and britain 83 % .

western european leaders who favor speedy economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their arsenal : the dizzy ##ing political changes under way in eastern europe .
they are stress ##ing that the best way for the west to help the east is to move faster towards western european economic and monetary unity .
mr . mit ##ter ##rand also proposed a separate ` ` bank for europe ' ' that would channel development money to the east .

howell , a port washington , n . y . , construction concern , was established in 1891 .
oh ##bay ##ashi officials said the purchase was undertaken to participate in ventures in and around new york city .
they said howell is particularly successful there because of its membership cooperation with local unions .
oh ##bay ##ashi is japan ' s second largest construction company .
until now , its inability to form membership ties with organized labor has kept it from penetrating the lucrative new york metropolitan area construction market .
the company also hopes the latest acquisition will help secure large construction orders from japanese concerns with u . s . operations .
as a result , u . s . trust ' s earnings have been hurt .
but mr . schwarz welcome ##s the competition in u . s . trust ' s flagship businesses , calling it ` ` flat ##tery . ' '
mr . schwarz says the competition ` ` broad ##ens the base of opportunity for us . ' '
other firms ` ` are dealing with the masses .
i do n ' t believe they have the culture ' ' to adequately service high - net - worth individuals , he adds .
u . s . trust recently introduced certain mutual - fund products , which allow it to serve customers with minimum deposits of $ 250 , 000 .
previously , the company advertised at the $ 2 million level .
` ` we have always taken smaller accounts , but now we are looking for smaller accounts that will grow , ' ' mr . schwarz says .
` ` our bread and butter is still the $ 2 million to $ 20 million account , ' ' he says .
the new services allow u . s . trust to cater to the ` ` new wealth , ' ' mr . schwarz says .
quarterly net income this year has risen just over comparable periods in 1988 , when year - end net was below the 1987 level .
assets as of sept . 30 fell to $ 2 . 46 billion from about $ 2 . 77 billion .
` ` we will have a reasonably flat year this year , ' ' mr . schwarz says .

quantum said it has agreed to purchase as much as $ 50 million in equity in the new company , if necessary , for the confirmation of the plan .
castle harlan and quantum said the plan is expected to be filed within 60 days with the u . s . bankruptcy court in pittsburgh .
the agreement is subject to certain conditions , including obtaining financing .
sharon , based in farrell , pa . , filed for protection from creditors under the federal bankruptcy code in april 1987 .
the company had been one of the mani ##nst ##ays of miami beach fin ##an ##cier victor po ##sner ' s empire .
mr . po ##sner resigned as president and chief executive officer of sharon in april 1988 .
he remains chairman , but wi ##eld ##s little power at the company .
quantum fund , based in new york , is a $ 2 . 1 billion investment fund managed by so ##ros fund management .
quantum is sharon ' s largest un ##se ##cured credit ##or .
the castle harlan group includes walter si ##eck ##man , former chief operating officer of sharon , and wolfgang jan ##sen , former executive vice president .
executives at sharon declined to comment on the proposal .
the company ' s trustee , f . e . ag ##ne ##w , was unavailable for comment .
two old friends , george bush and deng xiao ##ping , are trying to limit further damage to u . s . - china ties .
but as congress prepares a fresh package of sanctions against beijing , the already - tense relationship could get worse .
mr . deng added , says mr . lee , that ` ` we really made mistakes .
we must not shi ##rk our responsibility and we can not just blame the demonstrators . ' '
mr . jiang also pledged that the chinese red cross would publish ` ` very soon ' ' a list of those killed .
` ` i transmitted my conversations to the white house , ' ' prof . lee says .
but , he adds , ` ` i was not acting as a messenger . ' '
he says that the chinese never asked him to convey their statements to president bush , but that the white house spontaneously invited him to do so .
` ` the president does n ' t want to have legislative sanctions , ' ' says a u . s . official .
` ` but he may not have a choice . ' '
given china ' s far - from - con ##ci ##lia ##tory statements to its own people , mr . bush may be unable to prevent new sanctions .
beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations .
a university student got eight years for participating in the rallies , sources in beijing said , while an 18 - year - old worker got 10 years .
nor has beijing hinted to its citizens that it will publish the identities of those killed .
so far , the victims are officially considered evil - doe ##rs , and their families receive no compensation .
what ' s more , much of china ' s official rhetoric is hostile to the u . s . .
the house and senate are to begin soon hash ##ing out an agreement for sanctions legislation .
it will probably be attached to a state department authorization bill , which mr . bush is n ' t expected to veto .
a congressional staff ##er involved in drafting the sanctions says they are likely to mirror those mr . bush enacted shortly after the massacre .
but as legislative action , they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult to res ##cin ##d .
` ` bush and deng are hoping - lc ##b - that - rc ##b - cooler heads pre ##va ##il .
the amount of blood surgical patients can donate and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug , ep ##o .
ep ##o , or er ##yt ##hr ##op ##oi ##eti ##n , is a protein the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells .
a competing version of ep ##o is being developed by genetics institute inc . in cambridge , mass .
the drug is being used primarily to treat an ##emia ##s .
the patients began receiving ep ##o injection ##s about a month before their scheduled surgery .
they then began dona ##ting blood twice a week , receiving an ep ##o injection each time .
if tests indicated a low number of red cells , blood was n ' t taken .
that labor day , in his first major act after succeeding the resigned richard nixon as president , gerald r . ford signed the employee retirement income security act .
labor and business leaders , quoted at the white house rose garden rites , hailed its provisions for ins ##uring corporate pension benefits .
in 1972 , then treasury secretary george shu ##lt ##z , with the key support of sen . carl curtis , sought some form of pensions for the uncovered .
they used the 1962 ke ##og ##h plan , a pension plan created by a new york congressman for the self - employed , as a partial model .
this team initially called its new model personal retirement account , or ` ` pr ##a . ' '
so they opted for ira , naming it after ira cohen , a brilliant irs act ##uary who helped them .
this caused an explosion of ira promotions by broker ##s , banks , mutual funds and others .
but in 1986 congress sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and ira tax - de ##duction ##s slowed their roaring growth .
ira account assets have grown to about $ 400 billion from $ 39 ##3 billion last year and just $ 26 billion in 1981 .
the measure , which will take effect next wednesday , will create a two - tier exchange rate .
commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about 0 . 63 rub ##les to the dollar .
but for soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism , the rate will jump to 6 . 26 rub ##les to the dollar .
ta ##ss news agency said the dev ##al ##uation also will apply to foreigners ' transactions .
the current rub ##le rate has long been out of line with the black market .
as soviet leader mikhail go ##rba ##chev has opened up the country to foreign trade , the disc ##re ##pan ##cy has become ever greater .
even at such rates , black market ##eers have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here .
they use dollars to buy western items such as video recorder ##s and personal computers and then sell them at a huge mark - up .
even a pack of 20 western cigarettes can fetch 20 rub ##les or more .
rumors of an impending dev ##al ##uation have been circulating in moscow for weeks , but the size of the cut took many western bankers by surprise .
` ` it ' s much bigger than we expected , ' ' said one german banker , who asked not to be named .
soviet companies needing western cu ##rre ##ncies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids .
plans for the auction , which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event , have been thwarted by a lack of hard currency .
soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it , and joint ventures are n ' t yet allowed to participate .
the k ##rem ##lin also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction , using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods .
but the amounts they exchange may be limited ; most soviet hotels , for example , demand payment in hard currency from western visitors .
unless other rules are changed , the dev ##al ##uation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help : soviets who travel abroad .
over the past three years , thousands of people here have made use of loose ##r travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad .
but under current rules , they are allowed to change just 200 rub ##les into dollars and other cu ##rre ##ncies for each trip .
at the new rate , that would give them about $ 30 to travel on .
it is n ' t yet clear whether the 200 - rub ##le limit will be lifted .
if it is n ' t , the black market for dollars probably will continue to thrive .
but the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with ko ##dak to arch ##ri ##val digital equipment corp .
ko ##dak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with maynard , mass . - based digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs .
ko ##dak , based in rochester , n . y . , said ibm also had bid for the business .
ibm is based in arm ##on ##k , n . y .
the loss is a set ##back to ibm , which pointed to the ko ##dak contract as an example of its success in systems integration .
that ' s an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turn ##key communications and computing services to major corporations .
a ko ##dak spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract , which is still in negotiation .
` ` that ' s why we went with ibm for data center management . . . and now digital for voice and data telecommunications .
after 75 years there may be a few things that are worth re ##ex ##ami ##ning .
the regional federal reserve bank setup , for instance , may be out of date .
maybe the whole regional system is an ana ##ch ##ron ##ism ; the fed , after all , is a national central bank .
some of the would - be reformer ##s , however , want to restore an arrangement we once had - - or , at least , part of it .
in the beginning , the treasury secretary and the com ##pt ##roller of the currency were both ex off ##icio members of the federal reserve board .
carter glass , a former treasury secretary who was then back in congress , probably influenced the decision .
there is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least congress , as in 1935 , would be doing something .
so far no one has suggested putting the com ##pt ##roller back on the board .
nicholas brady , the incumbent treasury secretary , is of course aware of the proposal , and he does n ' t like it much .
mr . do ##rgen has changed tactics , dropping the seat - for - the - secretary idea .
like most treasury secretaries , mr . brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters , of course .
he was , in fact , taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury .
one of the commission ' s recommendations was that a single agency , probably the federal reserve , should coordinate regulation of all financial markets .
the fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well .
in recent weeks , moreover , mr . brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the fed toward lower interest rates .
at least some economists , of course , would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis .
earlier this month the st . louis fed held a conference to assess the system ' s first 75 years .
the inflation - growth argument is an old one , but mr . brady , on the board or off , is surely trying to influence fed policy .
the treasury can do something on its own , but to have any hope of success it needs help from the fed .
the central bank has been helping , but apparently not especially eagerly .
in other words , it was offset ##ting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market .
now , ste ##ril ##ized intervention may have some effect .
when traders see the fed is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully , for fear of what the central bank may do .
but it ' s generally accepted that ste ##ril ##ized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values .
after august the fed may have stopped ste ##ril ##izing , but it ' s hard to see much impact on the dollar .
the more we think about it , the more we suspect mr . brady does indeed have enough power where he already is .
this has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the iron curtain and interesting shifts in official american policy toward moscow .
our ability to influence the outcome of events in eastern europe and the soviet union is far more marginal .
those events continue to move at a rate , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary - - let alone policy - - far in their wake .
all of that is just for starters , or so the hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding .
it has been a well - paid transaction , this bart ##ering away of the prestige of the republic ' s highest office .
he was performing for pay , and why should anyone expect anything more ?
primarily because there ' s more to the matter than ronald reagan ' s personal values , or lack of them .
but if it was the national disease in 1906 , it is today the national commonplace .
if there is no law against it , do it .
if the law leaves loop ##holes , use them .
if there is no moral prohibition that express ##ly forbid ##s it , full speed ahead .
the soviet foreign minister publicly con ##cede ##s that his government ` ` violated norms of behavior ' ' in afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station .
we have people in high place still lying through their teeth about iran - contra , and that apparently is n ' t going to change .
for that matter , those long ago identified as liar ##s are still given respectful hearings in the press .
that is the key to the current ` ` national disease . ' '
no one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the narrow ##est construction of the law .
thus , no standards , no judgment and no values .
` ` you are mad because he ' s making so much money , ' ' say president reagan ' s defenders .
he was referring to the ` ` absolutely extraordinary ' ' events in eastern europe , and it is a def ##ens ##ible position .
but there is no defense at all for the et ##hos of the 1980s .
or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the united states of 1989 : everything for sale ; nothing of real value .
mr . carter is a political commentator who heads a television production firm .
ms . ko ##lb ##er said the committee had received other bids .
several ci ##ne ##plex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointing ##ly low or for only part of the company .
` ` if a bid material ##izes at that price , shareholders will have every reason to be glad , but the question of financing still remains . ' '
mca strongly opposed the dr ##abi ##nsky group ' s move .
ci ##ne ##plex shareholders responded cool ##ly to yesterday ' s announcement .
in trading on the new york stock exchange , ci ##ne ##plex closed at $ 11 , down 25 cents , with more than a million shares changing hands .
mr . dr ##abi ##nsky could n ' t be reached for comment .
two west german chemical companies announced steps that apparently are designed to boost the chemical industry ' s standing among environmental groups and the general public .
the company hopes the new plant , likely to be built in frankfurt , will be able to produce 10 , 000 tons a year .
this year , ho ##ech ##st will produce about 62 , 000 tons of cf ##cs in factories in frankfurt , spain and brazil .
of ho ##ech ##st ' s 40 . 9 billion marks in group sales in 1988 , 200 million marks came from sales of cf ##cs .
all of the companies are units of pan ##hand ##le eastern corp . , which acquired texas eastern corp . earlier this year .
adolph co ##ors co . said its co ##ors brewing co . unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the west beginning early next year .
co ##ors is hoping to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide .
co ##ors , with its large beer - distribution network , could penetrate more markets .
the company said the water will be called co ##ors rocky mountain sparkling water and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in co ##ors beer .
the test markets , though not specified , will be in northern california , arizona and colorado , some of the hottest bottled - water markets .
u . s . officials said the plan was flexible , and was intended as a pr ##ag ##matic approach for gradually removing trade - di ##stor ##ting subsidies .
` ` the american proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation , ' ' the ec said in a statement .
u . s . deputy trade representative jules katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the april accord .
he said he was surprised by the ec ' s reaction , calling it ` ` ve ##hem ##ent , even fr ##ene ##tic . ' '
ambassador katz said the u . s . was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries .
the u . s . administration said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the free - trade goals would be achieved .
but the ec is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs .
the new u . s . package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports .
it would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to imp ##ede trade ar ##bit ##rar ##ily .
bell atlantic corp . said it agreed definitive ##ly to acquire one of control data corp . ' s computer - maintenance businesses .
terms of the accord were n ' t disclosed .
control data ' s third - party maintenance unit services products primarily made by digital equipment corp . and international business machines corp .
the unit has 6 , 000 customers and , according to one analyst , had 1988 revenue of about $ 85 million .
however , control data would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its cyber product line .
earlier this year , the company sold a similar unit in europe for about $ 25 million .
two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and biography .
these decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars , and from journalists as well .
as for the merits , judge lev ##al said that mr . miller had written ` ` a serious book of responsible historical criticism . ' '
' ' in such circumstances , free - speech interests out ##weig ##hed the interests of the copyright owner .
still the sal ##inger decision created a strong pre ##sum ##ption against fair use of unpublished materials .
but the proper remedy , judge lev ##al said , lay in a suit for damages , not in an injunction .
the case went on appeal to the second circuit .
had the suit been filed in time , they said , ` ` bare - faced messiah ' ' would have been suppressed .
this was too much for james oak ##es , the court ' s chief judge .
` ` i thought that sal ##inger might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us .
and the injunction judges miner and alt ##ima ##ri would so readily have granted had new era sued in time ?
suppression of the book , judge oak ##es observed , would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the first amendment .
indeed , it would be ir ##res ##pon ##sible to ignore such sources of information . ' '
now , scholars in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation .
and of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers , whether in their own possession or as donated or sold to libraries .
but in the ` ` bare - faced messiah ' ' case the author found most of his material in court records or via the freedom of information act .
and when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials , copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quota ##tions that help to establish historical points .
judges oak ##es and lev ##al understand the requirements of historical scholarship .
judges miner and alt ##ima ##ri do not appear to have a clue .
yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law .
as matters stand , the sal ##inger ruling , torn from context and broadly con ##st ##rued , is controlling .
the courts have not defined ` ` minimal amounts , ' ' but publishers , i understand , take it to mean about 50 words .
the ` ` bare - faced messiah ' ' decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise .
a second decision , handed down in august by the court of appeals for the ninth circuit , is another blow against scholarship .
mr . mass ##on then brought a libel suit against ms . malcolm , the new yorker and kn ##op ##f .
for all historians and most journalists , this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the malcolm articles .
ms . malcolm , for example , wrote that mr . mass ##on described himself as ` ` the greatest analyst who ever lived . ' '
ms . malcolm had mr . mass ##on describing himself as ` ` an intellectual gig ##olo . ' '
again , no such statement appears on the tapes .
but it is not janet malcolm who calls him such : his own words reveal this psychological profile . ' '

legal controversies in america have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case .
they speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment .
his trials aroused public passions out of all proportion to the rather ban ##al secrets he allegedly had passed to soviet intelligence .
to the rest of us , the case is a puzzle .
it is what lawyers call ` ` fact intensive . ' '
it presents no great issue of legal principle , no over ##riding question of family law or the law of contempt .
instead , it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of ` ` who did what to whom . ' '
i suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of dr . morgan .
a second theme is the under ##cu ##rre ##nt of social class and race in the public reaction to the morgan case .

meanwhile , net at gm ' s finance arm , general motors acceptance corp . , fell 3 . 1 % .
by contrast , electronic data systems corp . , gm ' s data processing subsidiary , boosted net 16 % .
gm closed down $ 1 . 875 at $ 44 . 875 in new york stock exchange trading yesterday .
earnings for gm common stock , reflecting the performance of gm ' s core automotive operations , will be disclosed this morning .
gm class h , which represents a divide ##nd interest in hughes earnings , closed at $ 29 , up 25 cents in big board composite trading .
gm class e , which represents a divide ##nd interest in eds profit , fell 75 cents to $ 52 . 25 on the big board .
even excluding the charge , however , net fell 5 % .
that decline was reflected in revenue for the gm hughes unit , which edged down to $ 2 . 58 billion from $ 2 . 63 billion .
revenue rose 3 . 5 % to $ 8 . 47 billion from $ 8 . 18 billion .
at gma ##c , net dropped 3 . 1 % to $ 234 . 5 million from $ 241 . 9 million .
the finance unit attributed the decline to higher borrowing costs compared with a year earlier .
gma ##c profits are combined with earnings from the rest of gm ' s operations and attributed to the company ' s traditional common stock .
in the first nine months , gma ##c ' s earnings fell 8 % to $ 85 ##9 . 5 million from $ 930 . 2 million .
revenue rose 12 % to $ 1 . 37 billion from $ 1 . 22 billion .
revenue rose 14 % to $ 4 . 03 billion from $ 3 . 54 billion .
revenue from non - gm accounts was 45 % of eds ' s total business in the latest nine months , compared with 40 % a year earlier .
the company has said it wants to boost non - gm revenue to at least 50 % of its total business by the end of 1990 .

the bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court supervising ps of new hampshire ' s reorganization .
they are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of new hampshire , where residents fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization .
in addition , some of the proposals are so close , that non - financial issues such as timing may play a more important role .
the un ##se ##cured creditors agreed in principle to support new haven , con ##n . - based united illuminating ' s new bid .
they previously had backed an internal reorganization plan proposed by ps of new hampshire .
all of the bid ##ders con ##tem ##plate full payment including interest to secured creditors .
united illuminating ' s plan , however , offers more for un ##se ##cured creditors .
in addition , they would receive some $ 200 million in payments for interest since then .
mr . ka ##lm ##us said that by next july they would have acc ##rued unpaid interest equal to $ 350 million .
other plans generally would n ' t pay un ##se ##cured creditors ' interest acc ##rued since the filing .
under united illuminating ' s plan , a new holding company would be formed to own the two companies .
it would be 72 % - owned by united illuminating holders and 28 % - owned by current holders of ps of new hampshire preferred and common stock .
ps of new hampshire preferred holders also would get certain de ##ben ##tures and preferred stock .
united illuminating said the preferred holders total package would equal about 60 % of their claims .
common shareholders would end up owning about 6 . 4 % of the combined company .
as previously reported , northeast utilities , hartford , con ##n . , monday filed a bid it valued at $ 2 . 25 billion .
new england electric values its offer at $ 2 billion and ps of new hampshire values its reorganization plan at $ 2 . 2 billion .
the bankruptcy judge has ruled that federal bankruptcy laws could be used to ci ##rc ##um ##vent state regulation .
the state has endorsed the new england electric plan , which promises to limit rate increases to 4 . 8 % annually for seven years .
northeast utilities ' plan proposes 5 . 5 % annual increases .
ps of new hampshire amended its plan to call for two years of 5 . 5 % rate increases followed by five years of 4 . 5 % increases .
fuel cost adjustments could change the effective rate increases , however .
previously it had proposed seven years of 5 . 5 % increases .
the new offer assumes just five years of 5 . 5 % rate increases , to be followed by state - approved increases under the usual hearing procedure .
previously united illuminating had also called for seven years of 5 . 5 % increases .
the bids and rate proposals generally assume the sea ##brook nuclear power plant , which is completed , will go into operation .
most of the plans have reduced bids in case the plant fails to get a license from the nuclear regulatory commission .
the utility ' s stock closed at $ 4 a share , up 37 . 5 cents , in composite trading on the big board .
it said the maximum cost of the plan would be $ 9 . 7 million .
c . hyde tucker will become president and chief executive officer of bell atlantic international inc . , a unit of this telecommunications concern , effective jan . 1 .
mr . tucker , 56 years old , is currently vice president and chief operating officer of bell atlantic ' s c & p telephone unit .
richard breed ##en had n ' t noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone .
it was , after all , only his second full day as chairman of the securities and exchange commission .
now there are more lines connected to the chairman ' s office , and the market - monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk .
it ' s all part of a new ` ` command center . ' '
the changes in the office layout illustrate mr . breed ##en ' s stance as the nation ' s top securities regulator .
like his predecessor , david rude ##r , he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office .
also unlike mr . rude ##r , mr . breed ##en appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda .
as a former white house aide who worked closely with congress , he is sa ##v ##vy in the ways of washington .
but mr . breed ##en , a 39 - year - old securities lawyer , has skirt ##ed some of the he ##ft ##ier issues facing the financial markets .
he may be waiting to see the results of several pending sec studies of junk market liquid ##ity and disclosure rules .
congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while .
members of the senate banking committee know mr . breed ##en from working on the th ##rift - bail ##out bill , and the relationship generally remains warm .
not everyone has jumped on the breed ##en band ##wa ##gon , however .
some in washington contend that it ' s too soon to tell whether mr . breed ##en will help or hind ##er the sec .
` ` i do n ' t think this was a real test , ' ' says one congressional aide .
for some at the sec , an agency that cove ##ts its independence , mr . breed ##en may be too much of a washington insider .
they note that he has adorned his office with five photos of george bush , one of them featuring the first dog , millie .
they worry that mr . breed ##en also will roll over when told to do so by the white house .
but mr . breed ##en already has shown an eager ##ness to run the sec his way .
during the monday market rebound , a new york exchange spokesman told cable news network viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points .
stunned , mr . breed ##en turned to his market - monitoring computer , which by then was next to his desk .
sec staff ##ers soon determined that a widely watched stock - market service , quo ##tron , had mis ##cal ##cula ##ted the industrial average .
mr . breed ##en instructed sec staff ##ers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number .
` ` it was the plunge that did n ' t happen , ' ' he says .
mr . breed ##en also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event - - the california earthquake - - to move another rule change past congress .
that disaster closed the pacific stock exchange ' s stock options - trading operation , forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily .
congress ##men raised the issue yesterday at a hearing .
mr . breed ##en , not missing a chance to press his agenda , cited the earthquake .
that event , he contend ##ed , simply shows the ` ` vulnerability ' ' of having listings on only one exchange .
in a corner of the cavern ##ous , new nippon convention center sits mazda motor corp . ' s advanced - technology display .
the highlight : a ` ` fragrance control system . ' '
it ' s also the prime showcase for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged , and there ##in lies the draw .
even the biggest auto shows in the u . s . are largely regional affairs , but the tokyo show is international .
virtually every automotive analyst in new york showed up .
here ' s a first ##hand look at what the japanese hosts sport ##ed , and what the foreign visitors saw .
the hottest displays were items that ins ##ulate passengers from bumps , pot ##holes and other rig ##ors of the road .
these ` ` active suspension systems ' ' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car ' s ride .
existing suspension systems try to absorb bounce ##s , but active suspension provides power to counter the jolt ##s .
toyota motor corp . grand ##ly to ##uted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension ' s inner workings .
but drivers in the u . s . must wait : the japanese , for now , are keeping active suspension for domestic use only .
and detroit ' s big three auto makers say their systems are still under development .
by contrast , the pistons in conventional four - stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle .
honda says the five - cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel - economy of a four - cylinder , and the power of a v - 6 .
there ' s plenty of w ##him ##sy here , but it is n ' t always clear whether it ' s intentional .
the show ' s symbol is a woman riding on a snail , not your usual metaphor for speed and ag ##ility .
japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names , but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high - - or low .
honda has a tiny motorcycle called the monkey , and a slightly larger cousin , the gorilla .
mitsubishi has a futuristic delivery truck called the gu ##ppy .
mazda has the bon ##go truck and , under its auto ##zam name ##plate , a ` ` micro ##van ' ' called the sc ##rum .
its bug ##like carol mini ##car is ` ` designed with softness , gentle ##ness and warm ##hearted ##ness . ' '
but the court je ##ster appears to be japan ' s smallest car maker , dai ##hat ##su motor co .
dai ##hat ##su also has the fellow 90 , the lee ##za spider and the hi ##jet dumb ##o .
the jokes are n ' t just on the japanese , though .
reg ##ie nationale des us ##ines renault , the french auto maker , has a concept car called the megan ##e .
the name is supposed to con ##note feminine grande ##ur , but in japanese it means ` ` eye ##glass ##es . ' '
foreign auto makers are taking the tokyo motor show more seriously than ever .
hyundai motor co . of south korea has its first - ever exhibit in tokyo .
general motors corp . is sponsoring its first independent display in 10 years , and it includes a box ##y buick station wagon with wood - grain side panels .
ford and chrysler also have exhibits , although theirs are tucked in a separate room with the less - popular automotive parts section .
even so , traditional american cock ##iness is n ' t terribly endangered .
ford officials , for example , crowe ##d about their first - ever tokyo grand prix racing victory .
mr . jordan of gm , meanwhile , still critic ##izes japanese styling .
this is a classic example of the old saying , ` ` the whole is greater than the sum of its parts . ' '
the 33 % bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level , not just the 5 % rate adjustment amount .
it ' s equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement - savings tax incentive .
mr . ireland said current demand for used aircraft is strong , partly because sur ##ging orders for new aircraft have length ##ened waiting lists .
he predicted that p ##wa would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers .
p ##wa said two of the boeing 76 ##7 - 300 ##er aircraft scheduled for delivery in 1990 would be leased out for two to five years .
` ` i do n ' t see this as a debt reduction exercise .
it ' s focused on stream ##lining ' ' p ##wa ' s fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft servicing costs , the analyst said .
p ##wa said it also expects to announce by tuesday whether it will take delivery of all 17 airbus 320 - 200 aircraft it previously ordered .
the first five leased units were to be delivered in 1991 .
john pad ##ova ##n , 51 years old , was named a deputy chairman .
mr . pad ##ova ##n is currently a director at barclay ##s de zoe ##te wed ##d ltd .
graham pi ##ml ##ott , 40 , was named to the new post of chief executive officer of the merchant - banking corporate - finance division .
callum mccarthy , 45 , was named to the new post of deputy head of the corporate - finance division and a managing director .
mr . pi ##ml ##ott and mr . mccarthy join barclay ' s from klein ##wo ##rt benson ltd . where they served as directors .
the recent bids for united and american airlines have led congress to move with super ##sonic speed to protect incumbent airline management ##s .
in responding to questions , mr . greens ##pan played down reports of tension between the fed and the treasury over exchange - rate policy .
` ` what seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics , ' ' he said .
in other words , economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years .
he altered the word ##ing to win mr . greens ##pan ' s endorsement .
even so , his bill is given little chance of passage .
instead , the bill simply calls for twice - a - year meetings between the committee and top administration officials .
in recent months , sales of home improvement items have sagged , along with sales of other big ticket durable goods .
the show also signals mr . vila ' s return as a television celebrity .
earlier this year , public television station w ##gb ##h in boston fired mr . vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsement ##s .
in an interview , mr . vila criticized his old show , which is continuing with a new host .
` ` public tv is in fantasy land , ' ' he said .
his contract makes him ` ` exclusive ' ' spokesman for sears ' s home improvement marketing campaigns .
og ##il ##vy & math ##er in chicago , a unit of w ##pp group plc , will handle the advertising account and syndication .
the only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of time - life home improvement and repair books .
little matter for mr . vila , who complain ##s that ` ` public tv never paid me more than $ 40 , 000 a year . ' '
he said his compensation under the sears contract is ` ` a multi ##mill ##ion dollar deal .
eugene a . miller , 52 years old , was elected a director of this electric utility company , filling a vacancy .
he is president and chief executive officer of come ##rica inc . in detroit .
environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pest ##icides and may welcome part of the proposal .
but they are already object ##ing to , among other things , a plan to give more weight to cost - benefit considerations in evaluating pest ##icides .
` ` it ' s a tremendous disappointment , ' ' said janet hat ##haw ##ay , an attorney with the natural resources defense council .
the bush administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that em ##body them .
the principles would give the environmental protection agency increased authority and flexibility in regulating pest ##icides , with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly .
there already are proposals pending in congress to overhaul pest ##icide law .
in addition , the principles attempt to eliminate the so - called delaney paradox .
under the delaney clause , which applies to processed food , a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals .
among other changes , the white house wants to :
- - give the epa more flexibility to declare a pest ##icide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace .
- - speed up the process for removing a pest ##icide that is n ' t an imminent hazard .
- - bar states from setting more string ##ent tolerance levels for a pest ##icide once the federal government has set a standard .
- - give the epa added discretion to set ` ` ne ##gli ##gible risk ' ' levels for pest ##icide residues in processed food .
chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred , but those that fall below these levels would be allowed .
the dow jones industrial average lost 5 . 94 points to 265 ##3 . 28 in moderate trading .
the dollar was barely changed against the west german mark and up marginal ##ly against the japanese yen .
although bond prices were n ' t as volatile on tuesday trading as stock prices , traders nevertheless said action also was much slower yesterday in the treasury market .
many analysts are expecting the fed to lower interest rates at least once more before the end of the year .
investors now are awaiting today ' s release of the preliminary estimate of third - quarter gross national product .
economists predict the report will show economic growth of about 2 . 5 % in the third quarter , which would have little effect on financial markets .
but an unexpected deviation either way could roi ##l bond and currency markets .
volume on the new york stock exchange totaled 155 . 7 million shares .

competition could be maintained - - and stadiums probably would remain full - - if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the students , we said .
comments from the audience reflected widespread , if wi ##st ##ful , agreement with those conclusions .

officials at the department of revenue had dogg ##ed the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court .
but ` ` the check arrived in the mail , ' ' said stephen kidd ##er , massachusetts commissioner of revenue .
last month , mercedes - benz executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press , the commissioner said .
the dispute was the subject of a wall street journal article in august .
the amount covers taxes , interest and penalties owed from 1966 , when the state began collecting corporate taxes , to 1985 .
mercedes - benz also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years 1986 through 1988 , mr . kidd ##er added .
stores in hispanic areas will stock an assortment of spanish - language magazines , mexican cooking items and candi ##es .
stores in the company ' s core middle - class market will get more frozen and quick - to - prepare foods and a greater selection of bottled water .
` ` those are primarily white - collar workers , a customer segment that has historically proved elusive for convenience stores . ' '
still , southland said that its franchise ##es have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years , and that the company has begun to follow suit .
for instance , southland has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh sandwiches in some outlets .
several months ago , it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores , a spoke ##sw ##oman said .
` ` we certainly see an increasing trend toward that , ' ' she added .
national convenience said it has tested its new merchandise mix in 100 stores , with favorable results .
labor secretary elizabeth do ##le named a media ##tor to help resolve the lengthy labor dispute between the united mine workers and pitt ##ston co .
previous talks between pitt ##ston , of greenwich , con ##n . , and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful .
the union called the strike in april after pitt ##ston refused to sign the um ##w ' s national labor pact .
pitt ##ston seeks changes in health and pension benefits , among other things .
no schedule for formal talks was set , but meetings are expected to begin soon .
in addition to the forecast , the company also said it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead .
the spoke ##sw ##oman said the exchange would resume trading of del ##med stock today .
they were succeeded by executives of fr ##ese ##nius usa inc . and its parent , fr ##ese ##nius ag , which owns about 45 % of del ##med .
following that announcement tuesday , however , company officials were unavailable to elaborate .
del ##med said yesterday that fr ##ese ##nius usa would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels .
in any case , supplies to patients wo n ' t be interrupted , the company added .
the transaction also would combine fr ##ese ##nius usa and del ##med .
but the plan now is being ` ` reform ##ulated , ' ' del ##med said , declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination .
said the spoke ##sw ##oman : ` ` the whole structure has changed .
the value of the company has changed . ' '
del ##med did say that the proposal still would in ##fus ##e cash into del ##med but less than the $ 10 million originally expected .
del ##med also would receive the north american rights to certain fr ##ese ##nius ag products .
another option for del ##med , the company said , is that it could sell its plant in ogden , utah .
it added that no discussions about such a sale are under way .
brooks armored car service inc . never wanted to get into money laundering .
the water destroyed about $ 75 million in currency and cake ##d $ 4 million of coins with mud , rendering them dangerous to counting machines .
but brooks was unable to reach a coin - cleaning agreement with the government .
` ` we kind of got caught between bureau ##cr ##acies , ' ' says president william f . brooks jr .
the philadelphia fed says it is merely an ` ` agent ' ' for coins , responsible only for storage and distribution .
` ` we issue paper money ; we destroy paper money , ' ' says jane hi ##nk ##le , a philadelphia fed spoke ##sw ##oman .
` ` the coin is their problem . ' '
but brooks declined , figuring that transporting the mu ##cked up money to washington would cost the company thousands more .
so brooks gave the dirty work to coin wrap inc . , which came up with an unusual solution .
a giant heat ##er , working like a blow ##tor ##ch , causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrap ##pers .
after cooling , the coins are then re ##wr ##app ##ed .
brooks expects to pay coin wrap a total of about $ 20 , 000 - - a cost that insurance wo n ' t cover .
and while the job is half done , brooks is still bitter .
` ` parent ##hood , ' ' this summer ' s successful and amusing movie about parents and children , apparently was only the beginning .
it seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother ' s death , or adoption , or aging parents , or pregnancy .
some diaries simply are n ' t worth snoop ##ing in .
yet there will be people who will sob at ` ` immediate family , ' ' a limp ##ly constructed and offensive movie about adoption .
the film makers have couch ##ed this offensive idea in pretty packaging .
having exhausted all modern aids to fertility , linda and michael decide to adopt .
- l ##rb - why in these movies is the un ##wed pregnant woman always from ohio ?
i ask this not necessarily as a native ohio ##an . - rr ##b -
lucy , of course , is pretty and smart , though une ##du ##cated .
but in the end , everything turns out for the best , in the film makers ' warped view .
like lawyers in the hostile takeover field , the baby goes where the money is .
at the other end of the life cycle is ` ` dad , ' ' gary david goldberg ' s adaptation of the william wharton novel .
his characters practically sc ##amp ##er through a vast range of human emotions , like travelers doing 10 cities in eight days .
not even jack le ##mmon ' s expert dodd ##ering makes this trip worth taking .
but by comparison , this fluffy comedy seems like a gem .
it starts with conception , taking the sperm ' s point of view , then progresses to the baby ' s point of view .
finally , there is one family movie that quite el ##o ##quent ##ly explores the depth of human emotion - - only its stars are bears .
- l ##rb - ` ` quest for fire ' ' was the first time . - rr ##b -
supposedly , he proposed the movie to his producer , claude be ##rri , in four lines :
in 1988 , the company earned $ 82 ##2 . 8 million , or $ 5 . 66 a share , on sales of $ 12 . 49 billion .
since 1983 , west ##ing ##house has shed 70 businesses that it did n ' t expect to produce 10 % operating margins while acquiring 55 businesses .
west ##ing ##house expects to meet its corporate goals despite a soft ##ening in the economy .
g ##np is the total value of the nation ' s output of goods and services .
a bright spot is the company ' s power - generation business , which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years .
mr . mar ##ous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company ' s target goal of 8 . 5 % .
mr . lego said the company fore ##see ##s the need for a major boost in new - generation capability throughout the 1990s .
west ##ing ##house also is well positioned to sell steam turbine and gas turbine plants to independent power producers .
west ##ing ##house also expects its international sales to soon grow to 25 % of total corporate sales from 20 % last year .
mr . mar ##ous said west ##ing ##house would own 70 % of the facility .
the deal , which will involve an initial $ 20 million investment , was struck with a hands ##hak ##e , he added .
the executives did n ' t disclose the size of the expected gain .
capital expenditure in 1990 will rise slightly , mr . mar ##ous said , from an estimated $ 470 million this year .
because of an error by the national association of securities dealers , the listing appeared incorrectly in the main table and several highlight tables in yesterday ' s edition .
the national institutes of health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health - care businesses - - or lose their government money .
among other concerns , the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to fa ##ls ##ify findings in order to to ##ut new drugs .
as ties between academia and venture capital have blossom ##ed in recent years , governmental fear of abuse has risen .
the ni ##h is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until dec . 15 .
after that , it will make a final decision on the policy .
the high - tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect .
scientists rim ##a ka ##dd ##ura ##h - da ##ouk and paul sc ##him ##mel conducted the initial research at the massachusetts institute of technology .
the amir ##a transaction is typical of the way venture - capital firms are approaching the task of commercial ##izing biotechnology research .
` ` this is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities . ' '
and if that happens , the entire process of transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed , they say .
many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercial ##ize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties .
investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because ` ` we had exclusive rights to those technologies , ' ' he adds .
but under the proposed guidelines , all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capital ##ize on the work .
athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it .
but , says mr . bo ##ck , ` ` it was a close call . ' '
the proposed guidelines could also delay commercial ##ization - - and force small companies to waste scarce capital , entrepreneurs say .
du ##pl ##ica ##ting research is both costly and time - consuming for a start - up , ms . em ##yan ##ito ##ff says .
ni ##h staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the es ##cala ##tion of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures .
not long ago , scientists holding stock in spectra pharmaceutical services inc . were accused of fa ##ls ##ifying research to boost the stock .
many officials are also concerned about companies getting a ` ` free ride ' ' on government - sponsored research .
a congressional sub ##com ##mite ##e has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies exploit ##ing their research .
the predictions of doom are ` ` premature , ' ' she says .
but when agencies like the ni ##h ci ##rc ##ulate guidelines , they ' ve often already formulated policy , veteran scientists say .

ge capital corp . , a financial services subsidiary of general electric co . , is providing mer ##ks ##ame ##r management with $ 15 million in financing .
rumors to the effect that the mer ##ks ##ame ##r chain would file for chapter 11 arose last week in the jewelry industry .
at that time , sam mer ##ks ##ame ##r , president of the chain , angrily denied that his company was about to file .
mr . mer ##ks ##ame ##r is leading the buy - out .
according to executives close to the situation , mer ##ks ##ame ##r filed for chapter 11 to speed the sale of the chain .
the mer ##ks ##ame ##r bankruptcy - law filing appears to super ##sed ##e that agreement .
mr . mer ##ks ##ame ##r and sanford si ##gol ##off , chief executive of l . j . hooker , were unavailable for comment .
for all of this year ' s explosive run - up in stock prices , renaissance investment management inc . ' s computer sat on the side ##lines .
it was the first time since january that renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning .
the other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in treasury bills for the time being .
wall street executives said they believed that renaissance ' s $ 900 million buy program was carried out by pain ##ew ##eb ##ber inc .
the broker winning the business does n ' t charge commissions , but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price .
that puts the broker at risk if it ' s trying to buy stock in a rising market .
at the time , the dow jones industrial average stood at about 220 ##0 .
the computer ' s mis ##cal ##cula ##tion has been painful for renaissance .
almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results , while renaissance has played it safe with treasury bills .
three - month t - bill yields have fallen to 7 . 8 % from about 9 % at the start of the year .
stock prices , meanwhile , are about 140 points lower than the peak of 279 ##1 . 41 reached on the dow industrial average oct . 9 .
are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks ?
` ` our - lc ##b - computer - rc ##b - model has a certain trigger point , ' ' he said .
the firm has made 17 previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10 - year history .
mr . terri ##zzi confirms some clients have left renaissance , but no major ones , and the firm has added new accounts .
qin ##te ##x entertainment also said chief financial officer and treasurer jonathan lloyd , 37 years old , would join the nine - member board .
mr . evans will stay until a successor is found , but not later than the end of the year , the company said .
and the relationship between qin ##te ##x entertainment and the australian company appears to be quickly deteriorating .
qin ##te ##x entertainment was depending on qin ##te ##x australia to arrange financing .
but a majority of the board , which includes three members from the australian company , over ##rod ##e him .
mr . evans told the board he needed the weekend to think about it .
mr . evans could n ' t be reached yesterday for comment .
last monday , qin ##te ##x australia announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets .
last week the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital it would supply to qin ##te ##x entertainment .
qin ##te ##x australia said it had n ' t seen the suit and could n ' t comment .

the purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospect ##us issued in connection with mgm grand ' s planned offering of six million common shares .
in over - the - counter trading , mgm grand was bid at $ 17 . 50 a share .
the facility will be marketed toward families , and room rates will be between $ 35 and $ 55 a night , mgm grand said .
investors poured $ 2 . 8 billion more into money - market mutual funds in the latest week despite further declines in yields .
assets soared $ 4 . 5 billion in the previous week .
meanwhile , the average yield on taxa ##ble funds dropped nearly a tenth of a percentage point , the largest drop since midsummer .
` ` lower yields are just reflecting lower short - term interest rates , ' ' said brenda mali ##zia ne ##gus , editor of money fund report .
individual investors can still get better yields on money funds than on many other short - term instruments .
the yield on six - month treasury bills sold at monday ' s auction , for example , was just 7 . 77 % .
average maturity was as short as 29 days at the start of this year , when short - term interest rates were moving steadily upward .
the average seven - day compound yield of the funds reached 9 . 62 % in late april .
the highest - yielding funds are still above 9 % .
the top - performing fund in the latest week was dr ##ey ##fus worldwide dollar , with a seven - day compound yield of 9 . 45 % .
the fund invest ##s heavily in dollar - den ##omi ##nated money - market securities overseas .
it is currently wai ##ving management fees , which contributes to the higher yield .
the average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds fell to 8 . 14 % from 8 . 21 % , don ##og ##hue ' s reported .
the strategy boost ##s current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio .
trouble is , junk bond prices have been weak for months .
thus , the leverage has amplified the funds ' portfolio losses .
and shares of leverage ##d junk funds this year have been cl ##ob ##bered even harder than the junk bonds they hold .
` ` share prices performed even worse than the funds ' asset values because fear has taken hold ' ' in the junk market , he says .
leverage is used only by some of the closed - end funds .
the usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock , using the proceeds to buy additional bonds .
with a leverage ##d position of about 45 % , the fund ' s share price has plunged 28 . 5 % so far this year .
many investors are unaware their funds have borrowed to spec ##ulate in such a risky market .
if the market surge ##s , holders can make that much more profit ; the leverage effectively acts as an interest - free margin account for investors .
fund managers , for their part , defend their use of leverage .
carl eric ##son , who runs the colonial intermediate high income fund , says the fund ' s 25 % leverage has jack ##ed up its interest income .
mr . eric ##son says he tries to offset the leverage by divers ##ifying the fund ' s portfolio .
new america high income fund recently said that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $ 5 million in preferred stock and notes from investors .
the fund made a similar move earlier this year .
she declined to elaborate and would n ' t disclose the fund ' s recent purchases , sales or cash position .
` ` when the market turns around , ' ' she says , ` ` it will give a nice picture ' ' of how leverage can help performance .
several leverage ##d funds do n ' t want to cut the amount they borrow because it would slash the income they pay shareholders , fund officials said .
but a few funds have taken other defensive steps .
some have raised their cash positions to record levels .
high cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls .
` ` i do n ' t want to be in a position to have to sell , ' ' mr . fra ##bot ##ta says .
other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash .
` ` that ' s a problem because cash is n ' t earning us very much money , ' ' mr . bi ##an ##chi says .
he con ##cede ##s : ` ` this is the most difficult market that i ' ve been involved in . ' '
because of the recent junk - market turmoil , the fund is considering investing in other issues instead , including mortgage - backed bonds .
south gardens , as the bartlett scheme is called , will occupy the last 3 . 5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of manhattan .
it could cost taxpayers $ 15 million to install and bp ##c residents $ 1 million a year to maintain .
ms . bartlett ' s previous work , which earned her an international reputation in the non - horticultural art world , often took gardens as its nominal subject .
may ##ha ##p this metaphor ##ical connection made the bp ##c fine arts committee think she had a literal green thumb .
- l ##rb - ms . bartlett would not discuss her garden for this article . - rr ##b -
last year she boasted to h ##g magazine : ` ` i ' d never looked at a garden in my life . ' '
the third principal in the south gardens adventure did have garden experience .
the firm of bruce kelly \ / david var ##nell landscape architects had created central park ' s strawberry fields and shakespeare garden .
the bp ##ca called its team a ` ` stunning ' ' collaboration .
after four years , though , the south gardens design is 100 % un ##coll ##ab ##ora ##ted jennifer bartlett .
but for south gardens , the grid was to be a 3 - d network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them .
in a letter to the bp ##ca , kelly \ / var ##nell called this ` ` arbitrary and amateur ##ish . ' '
the landscape architects were expelled from the garden in july .
all the while , ms . bartlett had been busy at her assignment , serene in her sense of self - tilt ##h .
moreover , she proclaimed that ` ` landscape architects have been going wrong for the last 20 years ' ' in the design of open space .
` ` i ' ve always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail . ' '
last year the public was afforded a preview of ms . bartlett ' s creation in a table ##mo ##del version , at a bp ##c exhibition .
at the core of it all is a love for plants . ' '
plant lovers who studied the ma ##quette were alarmed .
they looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly .
ms . bartlett ' s little rooms left little room for plants or people .
kelly \ / var ##nell had put south gardens ' carrying capacity at four people per room , or about 100 humans overall .
inside the grid were 24 of these plant cells jammed full of cl ##utter .
one she made into a top ##iary rec room , rep ##lete with plants shaped into a bar ##cal ##oun ##ger , tv , piano and chairs .
in another , she re ##qui ##sit ##ioned top ##iary mx missile cones - - costing $ 10 , 000 each - - in heights up to 20 feet .
another she stuffed with eight ` ` rec ##ti ##line ##ar hedges ' ' for a top ##iary geometry lesson in the right - ang ##ling of plants .
in the herbal lounge she specified a ` ` plaid knot garden ' ' decor .
she ordered the foyer done in a different plaid planting , and made the landscape architects study a book on tar ##tan ##s .
in another compartment called the linden bo ##sque , 62 linden trees were to be crowded together at killing intervals of 10 or 16 feet .
- l ##rb - linden ##s need about 36 feet . - rr ##b -
ms . bartlett b ##lit ##hel ##y suggested calling upon ` ` semi - skilled garden club workers for maintenance . ' '
while the model was still on view , manhattan community board 1 passed a resolution against south gardens .
by removing the hedges and some walls , the bryant park restoration is opening it up .
it seems to me the bp ##ca plan has the potential of making south gardens a horticultural jail for people and plants . ' '
they then addressed the decidedly ` ` questionable safety of . . . a complex garden of endless hiding places .
- l ##rb - at harvard , ms . bartlett had declared : ` ` there are going to be problems with safety . . .
i ' m not going to address questions of safety ! ' ' - rr ##b -
bp ##ca president and ceo david emil hopes to negotiate a sea ##wall that could ` ` be significantly more visually per ##me ##able . ' '

after the study , the sec would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or fine - tuning the current ones , he added .
circuit breakers , designed to give the markets a breathe ##r in cases of sharp price movements , curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points .
at certain points during the friday the 13th drop , circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market , slowing trading at times .
a circuit breaker that would have closed down the new york stock exchange was n ' t tripped .
he argued that program - trading by roughly 15 big institutions is pushing around the markets and scar ##ing individual investors .
mr . breed ##en did n ' t reject the proposal .
the measure is expected to move through this congress .
but the new chairman ve ##hem ##ently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress .
mr . breed ##en contend ##ed that uncertainty over when the sec might act could worse ##n vol ##ati ##lity in the markets .
mr . breed ##en offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill .
one would force broker ##age houses to provide the sec detailed information about loans made by their holding companies .
he also backed a rule to require large traders to report transactions on a systematic basis .
that information , he argued , is critical to rec ##ons ##tructing sharp market moves , such as the one nearly two weeks ago .
they estimate the value of the transaction at close to $ 100 million .
k mart officials and mr . pile ##vsky would n ' t comment on the sale .
it is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping centers will have on earnings .
k mart developed the centers , which range in size from about 150 , 000 square feet to just over 250 , 000 square feet .
the retailer reportedly will lease its stores back from the developer , who plans to expand the small centers .
the centers comprise a total of about 1 . 6 million square feet of retail space .
they are spread around the country and include locations in california , florida , washington and arizona .
the company is active in office and residential development in new york .
however , nationally , mr . pile ##vsky controls through limited partnerships about 85 shopping centers with about 17 million square feet .
k mart runs 2 , 200 k mart stores , primarily in leased facilities .
the company typically sells the centers it develops , but has usually sold only one or several at a time .
so much of the stuff poured into its austin , texas , offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it .
now , thousands of mail ##ers , catalog ##s and sales pitches go straight into the trash .
` ` it ' s the over ##load problem and the weight problem we have . ' '
while no one has tracked how many company mail rooms throw out junk mail , direct - mail advertising firms say the number is growing .
anybody with a mail ##box can answer that : sheer , overwhelming , mind - numb ##ing volume .
though direct mail to businesses is n ' t broken out separately , the association says it ' s growing even faster .
the del ##uge has spurred cost - conscious companies to action , with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it .
the direct - mail industry , not surprisingly , is fu ##ming at the injustice of it all .
` ` but it ' s like biting the hand that feeds them , because every one of these companies uses direct marketing . ' '
and the practice often varies from location to location even within a company .
but industry executives say businesses seem especially inclined to dump mail ##ers sent to titles rather than to individual names .
at air products , meanwhile , the mail ##room staff opens junk mail and often throws it away - - even if addressed to an individual .
as of march 1 , its flint office , with about 2 , 500 employees , stopped delivering bulk mail and non - subscription magazines .
employees were told that if they really wanted the publications , they would have to have them sent home instead .
the reason : over ##load , especially of non - subscription magazines .
direct - mail executives see gm ' s stand as an ominous sign - - even if the junk - mail kings did bring it on themselves .
` ` it smack ##s of big brother ##ism .
they ' re going to decide what their employees can or can not read . ' '
the practice is , however , legal in most cases .
the junk - mail titans , ever optimistic , are looking for ways around the problem .
so far , they say , it has n ' t had any noticeable effect on response rates .
and before it does , they ' re trying to cut back on the cl ##utter that created the situation in the first place .
among other things , the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on du ##plication ##s .
but then again , mail ##ing less and smarter wo n ' t be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway .

senate democrats who favor cutting the capital - gains tax are n ' t ready to line up behind the leading senate proposal .
mr . pack ##wood all but conceded defeat , telling mr . mitchell : ` ` i sense at this stage you may have the votes . ' '
the two law ##makers spa ##rred in a highly personal fashion , violating usual senate decor ##um .
a major reason is that they believe the pack ##wood - roth plan would lose bucket ##s of revenue over the long run .
the pack ##wood - roth proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held .
president bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with democratic senators at the white house .
and at a lunch ##eon meeting tuesday of democratic senators , there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital - gains tax this year , according to participants .
the trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success .
he called the battle ` ` up ##hill . ' '
other democrats who favor a capital - gains cut are even more pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic .
` ` i ' m probably not going to vote for any capital - gains proposal .
the ira portion - l ##rb - of the pack ##wood - roth plan - rr ##b - is ir ##res ##pon ##sible . ' '
another significant factor in the capital ##gai ##ns debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between president bush and senate majority leader mitchell .
mr . mitchell has made clear to his wave ##ring colleagues that the issue is important to him personally .
today , sen . mitchell and other leading democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal .
a capital - gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage .
other possibilities include a child - care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage .
but the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the house and the senate .

president bush told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line - item veto .
vice president quay ##le and budget director dar ##man said recently they ' ve joined the search .
on tuesday , the subject came up again when mar ##lin fitz ##water explained the constitutional argument based on the provisions above to the white house press corps .
mr . g ##la ##zier discovered that the founders had worried that congress might take the president out of the loop .
labeling an omnibus budget a ` ` bill ' ' ca n ' t de ##pr ##ive the president of his power to veto items .
finding a test case should n ' t be hard , but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible .
the white house had the perfect case , but congress blinked before it could go to court .
they worried about an interior department directive to log all communications with members or their staff ##s .
the white house warned that this would be an unconstitutional us ##ur ##pati ##on of its power .
when it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line - item veto , congress cave ##d .
this means interior contacts can not be logged only on one day - - a sunday that had already passed .
if the white house is looking for another unconstitutional bill , rep . john ding ##ell is trying again to raise the fairness doctrine from the dead .
president reagan veto ##ed this as a first amendment violation .
there are also other provisions requiring congress ##men to join treaty - negotiating teams and new restrictions on om ##b .
unconstitutional bills make good legal targets , but the line - item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere f ##od ##der for lawyers .
commenting on the budget mess this week , president bush said : ` ` the perception out there is that it ' s the fault of congress .
and you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the american people . ' '
now ' s the time to make the political case that presidents need the line - item weapon to restore discipline to the budget .
congress is in no position to nay ##say mr . bush now that we ' re into gram ##m - ru ##dman ' s se ##quest ##ration .
just this week , the house - senate conference met - - 231 con ##fer ##ees , divided into 26 different sub ##con ##ference ##s .
president bush should take the constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work .
he should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork .
congress may have lost any sense of discipline , but that does n ' t mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess .
president bush has the power to change how washington works , if only he will use it .
they immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the company ' s problems .
investors interpreted the k ##kr move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of sci tv .
sci tv , which is controlled by nashville , ten ##n . , entrepreneur george gill ##ett , owns six tv stations , including several cbs inc . affiliates .
it is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in 1987 for a leverage ##d buy - out .
k ##kr would give up a 31 % equity stake to bond ##holders , while mr . gill ##ett would surrender an 8 % stake .
those investors think sci tv needs new equity to survive .
sci tv ' s debt restructuring plan would def ##er payment of $ 153 million of bank debt .
it also would def ##er interest and principal on junk bonds that have fallen due ; the grace period for paying the bill ex ##pire ##s nov . 16 .
at the same time , investors estimate the restructuring would cut the company ' s annual cash interest bill from about $ 90 million to $ 85 million .
yet to pay that interest bill , analysts say sci tv will only produce about $ 80 million to $ 90 million of cash flow a year .

radio mala ##ise draws the ear of the federal communications commission .

every day , mr . levy checks orders from camp ##eau department store chains , trying to guess if he will be paid .
` ` i ' m now monitoring every major account . ' '
next week , the country ' s top designers and manufacturers will begin showing fashion ##s for spring 1990 , the second most important selling season of the year .
and as the applause dies down in show ##rooms along seventh avenue and broadway , st ##yl ##ishly clad camp ##eau buyers will begin writing orders .
orders from camp ##eau retailers used to be cause for celebration .
this is no longer true because of camp ##eau ' s massive debt load .
` ` people wonder what ' s going to happen next . ' '
many manufacturers are worried about being paid for merchandise already shipped to camp ##eau stores .
but those dollars at risk pale in comparison to the investment required to make and ship spring goods to camp ##eau stores .
` ` i ' m buying fabric right now for clothes which i may not be paid for until april or may .
what happens to me if camp ##eau collapses between now and then ? ' '
some credit concerns , such as bernard sands credit consultants inc . , have told clients not to ship anything to fed ##erated or allied stores on credit .
` ` this is especially true for spring merchandise , ' ' says jim ri ##ndo ##s , credit manager at bernard sands .
` ` camp ##eau has too much debt . ' '
other credit houses , such as credit exchange and solo credit service corp . , are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping .
` ` the camp ##eau situation is a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze . ' '
because of those concerns , some manufacturers say they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise .
howard bloom , president of the dress firm chet ##ta b inc . , says : ` ` it ' s big time chaos today .
i ' m going to ship and hope i get paid .
if i need to ask for money up front later , i will . ' '
` ` they continue to pay their bills and will do so , ' ' says ms . sang ##er .
` ` we ' re confident we ' ll be paying our bills for spring merchandise as well . ' '
typically , manufacturers are paid 10 days after the month in which they ship .
if goods are shipped to bloom ##ing ##dale ' s between oct . 1 and oct . 20 , manufacturers expect to be paid by nov . 10 .
but manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods wo n ' t be paid until march , april or even may .
some in the market question whether camp ##eau will be in a position to pay bills at that time .
` ` everybody is worried about the possibility of cancellation ##s , ' ' says kurt barnard , publisher of barnard ' s retail marketing report .
` ` the buyers who work for the various camp ##eau chains may lose their jobs .
what that will mean for manufacturers is anybody ' s guess . ' '
camp ##eau ' s financial situation is complicated by an estimated $ 1 . 23 billion in debt due next spring .
the company has stated in recently filed financial documents that it anti ##ci ##pate ##s ref ##ina ##nc ##ing its march 1990 payments .
mr . mar ##mal ##stein adds that his company is now holding some goods in anticipation of being paid in full .
` ` it ' s become a day - by - day business , ' ' he says .
` ` business has never been this tough before .
not only does your product have to be excellent , but you also have to be able to collect . ' '
` ` the branches are just warmed over , empty halls , ' ' says mr . ko ##nh ##eim .
` ` why should i be part of that problem ?
i ' ve got limited production , and i ca n ' t give it to under ##per ##form ##ers . ' '
camp ##eau ' s ms . sang ##er disputes mr . ko ##nh ##eim ' s comments .
` ` many of the branches are very lucrative , ' ' she says .
` ` that ' s just nonsense . ' '
as for mr . levy at st . gillian , he says he will maintain his credit lines with the various camp ##eau stores unless they miss a payment .
` ` if they slip for 10 cents for 10 minutes , i ' ll stop , ' ' he says .
` ` it does n ' t bo ##de well for coming quarters , ' ' said john jacobs ##on , who follows the steel industry for aus consultants .
in fact , he thinks several steel ##makers will report actual losses through the third quarter of 1990 .
bethlehem , the nation ' s second largest steel ##maker , earned $ 46 . 9 million , or 54 cents a share .
third - quarter sales dropped 11 % to $ 1 . 27 billion from $ 1 . 43 billion a year ago .
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , bethlehem shares rose 50 cents to $ 17 . 375 .
of all the major steel ##makers , bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slow ##down .
it has n ' t diversified beyond steel , nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks .
ms . apple ##baum had estimated third - quarter earnings of 55 cents a share , but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected .
he noted , however , that the company ' s order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer , following the end of labor negotiations .
operating profit dropped 46 % in its specialty flat - rolled steel segment .
arm ##co shares closed unchanged at $ 10 . 625 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange .
sales increased in the quarter ended sept . 30 to $ 747 . 8 million from $ 62 ##3 . 5 million a year ago .
the latest period includes gains of $ 9 . 1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry - forward .
last year ' s results were hurt by $ 41 . 3 million in restructuring charges .

jack ku ##eh ##ler , ibm ' s president , said ibm is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific .
ibm also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing .
ibm already participates in one industry ##wide effort to improve semiconductor - manufacturing techniques .
ibm said it expects industry ##wide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive .
and ibm said it expects the costs to continue climbing .
but it said that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid - 1990s .
ibm said it thought more companies would become interested as the project progresses .
the project involving motorola concerns a technique , called x - ray lit ##hog ##raphy , that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips .
currently , chips are produced by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip , much as a camera produces an image on film .
x - rays , by contrast , travel straight ##er and can be focused more tightly than light .
they can make the masks brittle and can pass through material they ' re not supposed to .

mr . nad ##eau also is chairman and chief executive of un ##ige ##sco inc . , pro ##vi ##go ' s controlling shareholder .
mr . lo ##rti ##e ' s departure , while sudden , was seen as inevitable in light of the shift in strategy .

the company said its quarterly results are now being publicly filed as the result of the formation earlier this year of employee stock investment plans .
wall street would like ua ##l corp . ' s board to change its mind about keeping the company independent .
as a result , both may now have virtual veto power over any ua ##l transaction .
the two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts .
that gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work .
mr . ny ##e thinks the ua ##l board should be ousted if it does n ' t move soon to increase shareholder value .
both the pilots and mach ##ini ##sts have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they do n ' t like .
` ` the pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here , ' ' pilot union chairman frederick c . dub ##insky declared yesterday .
but whether the pilots can team up with their longtime ad ##vers ##aries , the mach ##ini ##sts , is another question .
the pilots ' mr . dub ##insky says his union would like majority ownership for employees .
at the very least , the pilots want some form of control over the airline , perhaps through super - majority voting rights .
on the other hand , the mach ##ini ##sts have always opposed majority ownership in principle , saying they do n ' t think employees should be owners .
still , in recent days , mach ##ini ##sts ' union leaders have shown some new flexibility .
if a compromise ca n ' t be reached , the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the mach ##ini ##sts .
but at this point , that may just be wish ##ful thinking .
the mach ##ini ##sts lobbied heavily against the original bid from ua ##l pilots and management for the company .
the pilots ' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a rec ##ap ##ital ##ization difficult to achieve .
` ` who would the board be working for - - the public shareholders or the pilots ? ' ' she adds .
ms . browning says she believes a rec ##ap ##ital ##ization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots re ##lent on their demand for control .
she also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now , they still could come back at a later time and try to take control .
but again , they may need the help of the mach ##ini ##sts .
` ` i think the dynamics of this situation are that something ' s got to happen , ' ' said one official familiar with the situation .
the board and ua ##l ' s management , he says , ` ` ca n ' t go back ' ' to business as usual .
` ` the pilots wo n ' t let them .
delta air lines earnings soared 33 % to a record in the fiscal first quarter , buck ##ing the industry trend toward declining profits .
revenue rose 15 % to $ 2 . 17 billion from $ 1 . 89 billion .
` ` the key to delta ' s record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth , ' ' said thomas roe ##ck , chief financial officer .
passenger traffic jumped 14 % in the quarter , while profit per passenger grew 2 % .
delta has benefited more than other carriers from the weakness of eastern airlines , which shares the atlanta hub .

for the quarter a year ago , columbia reported earnings of $ 16 . 3 million , or 37 cents a share .
total assets increased to $ 12 . 7 billion in the latest quarter from $ 12 . 4 billion a year earlier .
columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk - bond portfolio , the largest of any u . s . th ##rift .
on june 30 , loss reserves stood at $ 108 . 3 million .
th ##rift officials said the $ 300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of disposition ##s and market conditions .
because columbia now must sell the bonds within five years , accounting rules require the th ##rift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices .
the quarterly results also reflected $ 21 . 4 million in non - recurring losses from commercial real - estate activities in california .
columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market .
its shares closed at $ 5 . 125 each in composite new york stock exchange trading , down 37 . 5 cents .
the stock ' s decline accelerated in the past two weeks , from a price of $ 8 a share on oct . 9 .
its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of sept . 30 was 3 . 6 % , and total equity was $ 45 ##7 . 9 million .
columbia also has un ##real ##ized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than $ 70 million .

the 231 - 191 roll call illustrates the limits of power a res ##urgent abortion - rights movement still faces .
it continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two - thirds majority required to pre ##va ##il over mr . bush .

the package is more than $ 1 billion above the recommendations of budget director richard dar ##man this week .

the new york stock exchange is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today , just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up .
` ` customized ' ' baskets of fewer stocks will also be available .
the securities and exchange commission gave provisional six - month approval to the big board basket at a meeting late yesterday .
also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolio ##s by computer after regular hours on the midwest stock exchange .
the big board argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more - volatile forms of program trading .
es ##ps are also an attempt by the big board to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as london .
big board officials also hope japanese investors will become interested in the exchange ' s product .
the new stock baskets ` ` are going to make it easier for program trading to be done .
and it ' s going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . ' '
both the big board ' s exchange stock portfolio and the chicago exchange ' s market basket are designed for institutional investors .
the big board lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index - ar ##bit ##rage traders .
in index ar ##bit ##rage , program traders buy and sell stocks and stock - index futures to profit from small price disc ##re ##pan ##cies between the markets .
similarly , the big board hopes to en ##tic ##e merrill lynch & co .
neither has plans to be a market maker for now .
traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading .
big board officials say only 25 contracts a day may trade at first , equivalent to a day ' s action at a small , regional exchange .
` ` if we had the baskets , we would be leaving in casket ##s , ' ' one trader said .

officials of pittsburgh - based h . h . robertson , which makes steel roofs , store fronts and building parts , declined comment .

it has not , however , made a formal proposal .
the group also is engaged in talks with third parties regarding obtaining financing to buy more shares , but no agreements have yet been reached , the filing said .
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , h . h . robertson closed at $ 11 . 625 , up 62 . 5 cents .
attorneys involved in the talks said that the parties were closer to accord than they were a year ago , when reports of an imminent agreement circulated .
one individual said the shareholders ' accord was ` ` well worked out . ' '
the plaintiffs are investors who bought and sold securities in which mr . bo ##es ##ky and his partnerships were dealing .
some claim they suffered losses because they sold while he was buying and others because they bought while he was selling .
out of this , the government set up a $ 50 million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses .
separately , attorneys for the 42 or so limited partners have had serious discussions that could lead to the distribution of the partnership ' s assets .
the limited partners include insurance companies , financial institutions and individual investors .
an agreement with dr ##ex ##el regarding the limited partners ' investments is an essential step toward getting their money back .
dr ##ex ##el is owed $ 20 million by the partnership .

the fbi had said it would not be able to begin processing the request until june
he turned himself in to authorities in new york earlier this year .
he maintains that the information from the fbi will help him get his 1968 conviction vacated and his bail - jumping indictment dismissed .
his attorneys claim he was framed by the fbi and new york police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s .
but in federal court in manhattan , judge patterson said the fbi records could show that mr . ferguson ' s arrest was the result of questionable legal practices .
federal courts urged to cut costs and reduce delays of civil suits .
the study , conducted by a task force of the brook ##ings institution , suggests that congress should require the courts to develop the plans .
the study was initiated by senate judiciary committee chairman joseph bid ##en - l ##rb - d . , del . - rr ##b - .
complex cases , such as anti ##trust suits and many business disputes , would receive intense supervision by federal judges to keep pre ##tri ##al proceedings moving .
standard cases would require less judicial attention , and fast - track cases could be resolved quickly .
and the study said federal courts should set firm trial dates early in the process .
although some of the study ' s recommendations resemble those of similar projects , the makeup of the task force was unusually diverse , adding significance to the effort .
it included lawyers from civil rights and consumer groups , plaintiffs ' lawyers and defense attorneys , corporate counsel and law professors .
business ##land inc . said it purchased a major regional computer retailer , data systems computer centre inc . , springfield , new jersey .
the purchase strengthen ##s san jose , cal ##if . - based business ##land ' s links to the large corporations who are among the biggest buyers of computers .
john fitz ##si ##mmon ##s , chief executive officer of data systems , said the company was profitable and expected sales of nearly $ 100 million this year .
he said business ##land , which operates stores in 50 u . s . metropolitan areas , planned to absorb his firm ' s operations .
the consumer brands unit was absorbed by the photographic , pharmaceutical and chemical concern last year when it acquired sterling drug inc .

dismissing the trade group ' s numbers left traders plenty of time to worry an ##ew about the latest reports on op ##ec production .
estimates suggest october ' s figure may be even higher .
that level of production is n ' t of much concern as long as demand continues strong , analysts said .
but the first quarter of the year is generally the weak ##est and op ##ec production does n ' t seem to be slack ##ening in anticipation of that .
also , maintaining current demand assumes no significant slow ##down in world economies .
` ` we are n ' t seeing any cold weather here , ' ' mr . bo ##lling said from new york .
a level ##ing off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices .

traders who had sold contracts earlier , in hopes of buying them back at lower prices , yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses .
floor traders also said that the market could have been helped by rumors , which have been circulating for the past two days , about china purchasing cotton .
the rumor , which has been neither confirmed nor denied , has china buying 125 , 000 to 200 , 000 bal ##es for near - term delivery .
one floor trader said that if there were chinese purchases , they should have had a bigger effect on the market .
the modest sell - off , which started on tuesday , continued .
the december contract ended at $ 999 a metric ton , down $ 15 .

joseph w . robertson , 61 , was dismissed from those posts , the company said .
he could n ' t be reached and a company spokesman would n ' t comment on the dismissal .

japan is going on a capital - spending bing ##e that could make its trade surplus ##es even harder to shrink .
the more factories and robots japanese manufacturers add , the more they will be able to export , and the less their domestic customers will need to import .
some 70 % of them are to be exported to the u . s . .
even companies in smoke ##sta ##ck industries wrestling with world - wide over ##cap ##ac ##ity are joining the boom .
japan ' s steel ##makers are raising capital spending 22 % this year to $ 4 . 8 billion .
from a financial stand ##point , the boom could n ' t come at a better time .
many japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year , and japanese interest rates , though up a bit recently , are still low .
and in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest divide ##nds , companies can pl ##ow their profits back into plant and equipment .
but some economists and government officials here are n ' t app ##lau ##ding .
they fear that the boom may be too big for japan ' s or anyone else ' s good .
the ministry of international trade and industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending .
some economists - - and many japanese companies - - are puzzled by the warnings .
the investment boom is mainly sparked , they say , by strong domestic demand and is n ' t likely to increase exports sharply .
moreover , much investment is n ' t aimed at increasing capacity .
but the wo ##rrier ##s remain un ##con ##vin ##ced .
with japan running enormous trade surplus ##es against much of the world , they think that japan should meet the increased domestic demand by import ##ing more .
and eventually , they contend , domestic demand will weaken , forcing companies to emphasize exports again .
even in the short run , the investment boom could ex ##ace ##rba ##te a disturbing trend : japanese exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease .
in contrast to previous economic boom ##s , japanese auto companies are n ' t just trying to boost production .
others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once .
so many companies are investing in high - tech machinery that fan ##uc ltd . , a robot maker , also had to build a new plant .
the build ##up is ` ` making japan clearly more efficient , more technological ##ly advanced and more competitive , ' ' declares a western diplomat in tokyo .
but whatever its effects on exports and imports , japan ' s investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand .
japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high - priced goods such as 29 - inch television sets and luxury cars .
he adds that the company is trying to keep up with demand ` ` by over ##working ' ' its employees .
with demand growing and workers in short supply , many japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on automation .
once one japanese company steps up its investments , the whole industry follows .
because most businesses put market share above profit ##ability , to let a competitor ' s addition to capacity go un ##mat ##ched is to con ##cede defeat .
the emphasis on market share is evident at dai ##kin industries ltd . , japan ' s biggest maker of industrial air condition ##ers .
seeing new office buildings sp ##rou ##t up and its sales so ##ar , dai ##kin is building another plant , which will lift its production capacity 50 % .
the expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company ' s market share to 30 % from 27 % currently .
` ` until now , we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities we already had .
but we ca n ' t produce enough anymore . ' '
the competition is even more heated in the auto industry , where companies are racing one another in a world - wide market .
those who are n ' t worried about how japanese manufacturers ' investments will affect trade note that many new products are n ' t replacements for imports .
` ` it ' s important to gain leadership , ' ' a to ##shi ##ba spokesman says .
meanwhile , to ##shi ##ba ' s japanese rivals , hit ##achi , fuji ##tsu ltd . and nec corp . , are n ' t sitting still .
the new chip plants ` ` wo n ' t be excessive investment , ' ' says haji ##me sas ##aki , an nec vice president .
` ` we have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products . ' '
some of japan ' s goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas .
toyota plans to raise lex ##us exports when a new plant starts up next year .
if excess capacity develops , they say , not everyone will suffer .
the losers will be those with the least attractive products , and many of them , analysts think , will be foreign companies .
the portland , ore . , th ##rift said the restructuring should help it meet new capital standards from the financial institution reform , recovery and enforcement act .
a year ago , benjamin franklin had profit of $ 1 . 8 million , or 23 cents a share .

the company said the restructuring ' s initial phase will feature a gradual reduction in assets and staff positions .

federal health officials are expected today to approve a program granting long - def ##erre ##d access to the drug az ##t for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome .
announcement of the approval is expected to be made by louis sullivan , secretary of health and human services .
the drug will be given treatment investigation ##al new drug status , a label accord ##ed to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval .
the move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection .
adults with aids have had access to az ##t since fda approved the drug ' s usage for adults in march 1987 .
so far , aids has stricken 1 , 85 ##9 children under age 13 , with many times that number believed to carry the infection without symptoms .
to date , 1 , 01 ##3 of those children have died , according to the federal centers for disease control .
one of them , a daughter ariel , died a year ago at age seven after her parents unsuccessfully pleaded for the drug .
` ` i could get az ##t , ' ' says mrs . g ##lase ##r , who bears her infection without any symptoms .
` ` but my daughter could n ' t , until she was too ill to take it .
to watch your child die is an inhuman experience . ' '
her son , healthy and sy ##mpt ##om - free , currently takes no medication .
the delay in getting az ##t to children has been blamed on a combination of factors .
traditionally , the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses , because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape .
since then , roughly 50 pediatric patients have received the drug in his program .
to some mothers , the expected fda action is a po ##ignant reminder of what might have been .
` ` my first reaction is i do n ' t understand why it ' s taken so long .
` ` why did it take burroughs well ##com ##e so long to apply ' ' for treatment investigation ##al new drug status ? the new york democrat asked .
` ` there ' s no finger to be pointed , ' ' she said .
aids dementia - - which gradually steals children ' s ability to speak , walk and think - - is often the most striking aspect of the pediatric syndrome .
for some patients , az ##t has restored the ability to ride a bicycle or solve puzzles , giving back a piece of their childhood if only temporarily .
avon rent - a - car & truck corp . said it declared a divide ##nd of one warrant for each three shares of common stock .

each of the class c warrant ##s will enable the holders to purchase one share of common stock at $ 5 . 50 .
the warrant ##s may be exercised until 90 days after their issue date .
iss ##uance of those warrant ##s will be at the rate of one - third warrant for each warrant exercised .

in the first nine months of this year , business failures dropped 15 . 6 % to 37 , 820 from 44 , 79 ##6 .
except for a few spots , notably georgia , virginia and michigan , failures declined almost across the board , according to the business information services company .
d & b defines a business failure as a company that closes with losses to creditors .
the current decline in failures continues a trend begun in late 1987 , d & b said .
failures in seven of nine regional areas fell more than 10 % in the nine months .
this occurred partly because of more competition as the number of new businesses surged .
the troubled savings - and - loan industry and subsequent stress in real - estate businesses fueled bankrupt ##cies in this sector , d & b said .
a major tokyo newspaper reported that a japanese department store concern is planning to offer about $ 1 . 3 billion to buy bloom ##ing ##dale ' s .

the suit , filed in u . s . district court in manhattan , seeks class - action status .
the suit accuse ##s the retailer and several of its officers of making false and misleading statements about the company ' s business affairs .

a spokesman for mcc ##aw said the company was ` ` moving forward with our financing . ' '
he added that ` ` hopefully lin will conduct a fair auction . ' '
the offer is in limb ##o , however , because lin has agreed to merge its cellular - phone businesses with bells ##outh corp .

the good news - - to fans of stable credit , at least - - is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers .
apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk .
and investors , at least for now , took a pass .
t ##w ' s junk bonds were n ' t , as junk bonds go , unusually weak .
but unless they continued to grow , t ##w , based in para ##mus , n . j . , would have run into trouble .
until recently , such buy - now , pray - for - growth - later deals were routine .
` ` investors , ' ' he adds , ` ` are getting religion . ' '
the t ##w buy - out may yet be financed .
` ` there is nothing wrong with the company , ' ' says con ##isto ##n principal paul tierney .
the rub , he says , is that ` ` the junk market is n ' t as deep ' ' as before .
t ##w ' s stock ##holder meeting was postponed from tomorrow to nov . 21 .
by then , dl ##j hopes to be able to sell less - junk ##y junk bonds .
go ##llus ##t , tierney & oliver is likely to contribute more than the $ 120 million in equity it had planned on .
and the total amount of junk financing will be reduced .
people said they did n ' t think a billion - dollar deal would trade . ' '
and by adding equity , dl ##j would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern .
indeed , the dl ##j banker says , in the reborn capital structure cash coverage of interest ` ` will meaningful ##ly improve . ' '
as he sums it up : ` ` we are listening to the market . ' '
what is it , to borrow a term from con ##isto ##n , that so un ##sett ##led the market ?
some of the same risks that were cited - - and seemingly ignored - - in dozens of previous junk offerings .
in fact , dl ##j says , the company en ##vision ##s capital expenses of about $ 180 million a year .

but while the composite gained 1 . 19 , to 46 ##2 . 89 , many issues did n ' t participate in the advance .
` ` it was a mixed bag , ' ' said richard bruno , who heads over - the - counter trading at pain ##ew ##eb ##ber .

one day last march , cbs sports president neal pi ##lson and olympics super ##age ##nt barry frank met for lunch at the lot ##os club here .
mr . frank told mr . pi ##lson that olympics officials wanted $ 290 million or more for tv rights to the 1994 winter games in norway .
at that price , cbs was the only player at the table when negotiations with the international olympic committee started in toronto aug . 23 .
dick pound , a committee member , began by disc ##los ##ing that abc and nbc had refused to even bid .
mr . pi ##lson and his team huddled in a hallway and took just 10 minutes to return with a $ 300 million offer .
mr . pound responded , ` ` it ' s a deal . ' '
a beaming mr . pi ##lson announced his last ##est coup at a news conference that afternoon .
mr . pi ##lson ' s rivals at abc and nbc grimaced at the price .
how could cbs get pushed into out ##bid ##ding itself ?
` ` the price of poker has gone up , ' ' crows charles m . ne ##inas , the college football association ' s executive director .
cbs itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong .
while rights fees head sky ##ward , ad rates wo n ' t .
ad ##vert ##iser ##s already are bal ##king at higher prices .
` ` the networks are paying too much for rights , ' ' warns ad ##man paul isa ##cs ##son of young & rub ##ica ##m .
soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater cl ##utter of commercials .
cbs has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids - - that is , can the network alone make a profit on it ?
the billion - dollar question is , how much are those benefits worth ?
and three years later , in a sea of red ink , the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do . ' '
` ` they lost the entertainment crown , and they needed one .
that ' s well over half a billion dollars more than abc and nbc were willing to pay .
next month , talks will begin on two coveted cbs contracts , for the pro and college basketball finals .
cbs is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them .
the potential bill : more than $ 600 million for several seasons , an 80 % jump .
and the winners will be the colleges , not either network .
nor , by the way , ad ##vert ##iser ##s . ' '
mr . pi ##lson is an unlikely big spend ##er .
` ` and yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today . ' '
but the 49 - year - old mr . pi ##lson is hardly a man to ignore the numbers .
a yale law school graduate , he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at metro ##media inc . and the william morris talent agency .
in 1976 , he joined cbs sports to head business affairs and , five years later , became its president .
` ` our competitors say we over ##bid them .
maybe we recognize values the other guys do n ' t , ' ' mr . pi ##lson says .
mr . pi ##lson ' s ` ` major events ' ' strategy je ##lled after mr . tis ##ch took over .
mr . tis ##ch , a billionaire in hotels and finance , was just learning the tv business .
then , in may 1988 , mr . tis ##ch urgently needed to make a bold statement to que ##ll rumors that he might sell the network .
it ' s also a fast fix for an ai ##ling image .
but top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences 30 % or 40 % larger than those cbs usually gets .
and the winter olympics will air during the february ` ` sweeps , ' ' when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations .
that will please once - gr ##ump ##y affiliates - - another aim of the pi ##lson plan .
they glee ##fully await the ` ` dream season ' ' in 1990 .
cbs will air the super bowl , baseball playoffs , college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events .
the cbs plan to use big - time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success , however .
no amount of h ##ype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak .
` ` if the show ai n ' t a killer , they ' re gone . ' '
last october , during the 1988 summer games , nbc relentless ##ly pitched a new series , ` ` ta ##tting ##ers . ' '
moreover , sports is hardly the best way to lure adult women .
though cbs might move up to no . 2 in household ratings , most ad ##vert ##iser ##s buy based on ratings for women aged 18 to 49 .
cbs may remain a distant no . 3 in that regard .
nor is cbs a sho ##o - in to get blockbuster ratings .
in recent years , the world series and the olympics were aired against cbs ' s last - place lineup .
but cbs will put the athletes up against bill co ##sby , ` ` cheers ' ' and other shows in nbc ' s no . 1 schedule .
even the boon to affiliate relations may be limited .
the sports lineup may add only 1 % to 5 % to a station ' s annual profits .
it alone is n ' t likely to stop a station from dumping cbs shows .
` ` you ' ve got to judge where the network will be in three years . ' '
the int ##ang ##ible benefits may prove extremely costly if cbs ca n ' t avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself .
and avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort .
nevertheless , he dee ##ms the deal ` ` plain smart ' ' for its huge promotional value .
` ` it ' s too early to tell ' ' what happens after that , he says .
but mr . tis ##ch expects losses in all four years of the contract , he told u . s . senators last june .
yet cbs will air only 12 regular - season games , 26 fewer than abc and nbc .
if the playoffs end in four - game sweeps , losses could so ##ar .
ad ##vert ##iser ##s are resisting higher prices , which would help close the gap .
cbs signed general motors and toyota to be the only auto - maker sponsors in baseball for four years .
other ad ##men , however , say rates could rise later if ad spending surge ##s .
cbs expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating .
abc lost $ 75 million on the 1988 winter games , partly because of its $ 309 million rights fee .
cbs will add 25 1 \ / 2 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events .
- l ##rb - turner broadcasting will pay cbs $ 25 million to air 50 hours of cbs coverage plus 50 hours of additional events . - rr ##b -
` ` it does n ' t mean anything - - it ' s public - relations money . ' '
i would tend to trust their judgment . ' '
that would cut into cbs ' s slim margin for profit - - and error .
cbs sports earned $ 50 million or so last year .
and cbs takes in the least money in prime time ; abc and nbc charge 30 % to 35 % more for ads , according to a variety survey .
but cbs ' s costs are huge , and the risks go up with each new sports package that cbs locks up .
although sports officials predict jumps of 50 % to 100 % in the major contracts coming up for renewal , ad rates may rise only 20 % .
cbs hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time .
cbs may cushion losses with about $ 200 million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling cbs records and other businesses .
but media - stock analyst richard j . macdonald of macdonald grip ##po ri ##ely says wall street wo n ' t take kindly to that .
` ` on a stand - alone basis , the network ought to make money , ' ' he says .
when mr . pi ##lson is asked directly - - can you make money on all this ? - - he does n ' t exactly say yes .
` ` what you ' re really asking is , are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? ' ' he says .
that ' s the only question we need to address .
place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are the clerk who answers wo n ' t be the only one on the line .

ea ##ves ##drop ##ping - - both corporate and private - - is on the rise , thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies .
` ` our expectation of confidential ##ity is being eroded . ' '
on the corporate side , companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service .
the practice is common at catalog , insurance and phone companies , banks and tel ##ema ##rke ##ters , according to trade groups and worker organizations .
it ' s also widespread for reservations clerks in the airline , car - rental , hotel and railroad industries .
the communications workers of america , which opposes such monitoring , says supervisors listen in on an estimated 400 million calls each year .
some wall street firms monitor for record ##keeping purposes .
businesses ` ` want to verify information and ensure accuracy , ' ' says john hilt ##une ##n , di ##cta ##phone ' s manager of media relations .
the state of alaska recently bought the ve ##rit ##rac system , he says , ` ` to monitor the ex ##xon cleanup effort . ' '
merrill lynch & co . and shear ##son lehman hutton inc . say they use voice - activated systems to record and verify orders between sales ##men and traders .
shear ##son says it has taped some of its institutional trading desk ##s , such as commodities and futures , for about four years .
both companies stress that employees know they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n ' t taped .
kidd ##er peabody & co . says it monitors bond - trading conversations between broker ##s and customers to safeguard order accuracy .
ea ##ves ##drop ##ping by individuals is harder to measure .
but devices are there for the asking , whether in stores or through the mail .
the most common use of spying devices is in divorce cases , say private investigators .
while tape recordings to uncover , say , in ##fide ##lity are n ' t ad ##missible in court , they can mean leverage in a settlement .
concerned with the increased availability of surveillance technology and heavier use of it , law ##makers have proposed laws addressing the issue .
nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring .
and four states - - california , florida , michigan and pennsylvania - - have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded .
two bills in congress hope to make such restrictions national .
in addition , products such as voice - activated tape recorder ##s would have to include bee ##p tones and labels explaining federal laws on ea ##ves ##drop ##ping .
the outlook on both federal bills is uncertain , especially remembering the 1987 defeat .
the ac ##lu and worker organizations back tighter laws , but employers and device manufacturers object .
` ` but the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening . ' '
the powerful group , which represents many of the nation ' s tel ##ema ##rke ##ters , was instrumental in der ##ailing the 1987 bill .
sp ##ieg ##el also opposes the bee ##per bill , saying the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders , causing irritation and even errors .
laura dale , center manager at the catalog company ' s customer order center in reno , ne ##v . , defend ##s monitoring .
john bono ##mo , a ny ##ne ##x spokesman , says the telephone company needs to monitor operators to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job .
` ` sometimes , ' ' he says , ` ` we ' ll pull someone off the phones for more training . ' '
federal wire ##ta ##p statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees ' for evaluation purposes .
and in the past , congress has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations .
the cw ##a claims that monitoring not only in ##fr ##inge ##s on employee privacy , but increases stress .
meanwhile , supporters of the dell ##ums two - party consent bill say it is needed because of a giant loop ##hole in the one - party consent law .

` ` everything sold at radio shack has a legal purpose , ' ' says bernard app ##el , president of the tan ##dy corp . subsidiary .
still , radio shack is aware that some of its products are controversial .
a few years ago , the company voluntarily stopped selling ` ` the big ear , ' ' a powerful microphone .
` ` but we were getting too many complaints that people were using them to ea ##ves ##drop on their neighbors . ' '
ibm fired back with new main ##frame ##s of its own , extending the long - dominant 309 ##0 line with a 7 % to 14 % power boost .
but digital ' s move into main ##frame ##s will target ibm ' s home turf , where it has a commanding 70 % share of the market .
digital , maynard , mass . , insisted yesterday that its marketing focus would differ sharply from ibm ' s .
` ` this is not your father ' s main ##frame , ' ' said allan mcguire , a digital spokesman .
` ` it ' s a whole new generation , ' ' he said .
prices on the larger models , which range as high as $ 13 million , generally wo n ' t change .
small models , whose performance increased as much as 46 % , will carry higher prices .

analysts were disappointed that digital ' s new line apparently wo n ' t contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal year , which begins in july .
but he added that he expected to raise his estimate for fiscal 1991 at the same time .
after the announcement yesterday , digital shares gained $ 1 . 25 to close at $ 89 . 875 in new york stock exchange composite trading .
ibm shares closed at $ 103 , down 50 cents , in big board trading .
analysts have predicted strong pen ##t - up demand for the new line among digital ' s customers .
large digital buyers say the new va ##x will let them stay with digital when they need the power of a main ##frame , instead of turning to ibm .
` ` i ' m convinced there ' s a huge market for this machine , ' ' said stephen smith of pain ##ew ##eb ##ber inc .
digital also plans to compete fiercely with ibm when the giant ' s customers are computer ##izing new aspects of their businesses .
digital , however , does n ' t expect to di ##sp ##lace ibm main ##frame ##s that are already installed at big companies .
the slow - growing main ##frame market also has shown new signs of life lately .
ibm ' s main ##frame sales have held up better than expected this year , with analysts est ##imating they have risen 10 % to 12 % .
` ` demand for these systems has been very , very strong , ' ' said bill grab ##e , a senior ibm marketing executive .
` ` we have a good strong back ##log for the fourth quarter even without ' ' the systems that were announced yesterday .
the fourth quarter is always ibm ' s biggest by far , with most sales coming in december as customers seek to use budgets before year end .
that should help ibm address the damage that a res ##urgent storage technology corp . has inflicted in that market .

on capitol hill , though , there does n ' t seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit - reduction bill .

much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour .

` ` it ' s hard to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclic ##al . ' '
some lawyers say the slump , while more obvious in recent weeks , began earlier this year .

the japanese want us to accept their culture , but they refuse to accept the american culture .
japanese managers ca n ' t expect americans to behave as if they were japanese ; instead , they must manage americans as americans .
americans are expected to conform to the japanese culture when in japan .
what is wrong with expecting the japanese to conform to american norms when they locate here ?
americans place native or native speakers in charge of subsidiaries overseas .
european multinational ##s do likewise ; even in america , their affiliates are usually run by american managers .
but the japanese insist upon japanese managers everywhere they set up shop .
do the japanese feel so superior that they can not find capable american managers ?

while mr . ka ##ge ##yama does an excellent job of explaining the differences , both cultural and phil ##oso ##phic , i question his perspective .
would he suggest that employees of an american company doing business in japan conform to their new bosses ' culture and philosophy ?
thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand \ / adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating .
the workers can be motivated , and the company reach its full potential , only when management embrace ##s the employees ' perspective .

mr . ka ##ge ##yama is accurate to deny a specific anti - american bias .

as a presidential candidate in 1980 , george bush forth ##right ##ly expressed his position on abortion in an interview with rolling stone magazine published that march .
what did he think of the supreme court ' s decision legal ##izing abortion ?
` ` i happen to think it was right , ' ' mr . bush said flatly .
a few months later , mr . bush became ronald reagan ' s running mate .
suddenly , george bush the pro - choice advocate became george bush the anti - abortion ##ist .
and the va ##ci ##llation did n ' t end there .
but only four days after that , mr . bush resurrected the veto threat .
the result is mist ##rus ##t and criticism from all around .
anti - abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally .
he ' s totally geared to a pun ##itive position . ' '
mr . bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question .
for most of the past nine years , he has strive ##n to convince anti - abortion activists of his st ##al ##wart support for their position .
many americans still ago ##ni ##ze over their own personal feelings about abortion .
the political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and he ##wed to it , experts insist .
the need for consistency is especially acute for mr . bush , who , mr . sears maintains , lacks a strong ideological base .
yet he is also firmly bound by his hard - line rhetoric and promises he made to anti - abortion activists during his long pursuit of the white house .
on many issues - - flag - burning , for instance - - his keen political sen ##sit ##iv ##ities overcome such conflicts .
these days , when others raise the subject of abortion , the usually lo ##qua ##cious president can be close - mouthed almost to the point of curt ##ness .
ten days ago he was asked to amp ##li ##fy the reasons behind his anti - abortion stance .
` ` my position is well - known and well - stated , ' ' he replied .
in his rolling stone interview in 1980 , mr . bush volunteered his abortion - rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival , ronald reagan .
throughout the early 1980s , mr . bush was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and inc ##est and sometimes opposing it .
at the go ##p convention last year , he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape , inc ##est and life end ##anger ##ment .
he again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlaw ##ing abortion .
but when the high court ruled in the webster case in july , the president began to lower the volume .
when the ruling was handed down , the vacation ##ing president dispatched chief of staff john sun ##un ##u to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself .
the session failed to en ##act any new curb ##s .
now , some see mr . bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape .
christopher cox ' s oct . 13 editorial - page article ` ` toward more cr ##ip ##pling lawsuits . . . ' ' misses the point .
the 1989 americans with disabilities act is about eliminating disc ##rim ##inatory barriers .
this is how american women won the right to vote .
and it is how african - americans and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation .
for the more than 43 million americans with disabilities , the 1989 americans with disabilities act provides the missing piece .
disabled americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since section 50 ##4 was passed as a part of the 1973 rehabilitation act .
the 1989 act simply extends these guarantees to the private sector .
those who fear a pl ##eth ##ora of suits para ##ly ##zing our legal system need only look at the record on the rehabilitation act .
without legal rec ##ours ##e , there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone .

former us ##x corp . chairman david m . roderick may have been lucky he retired last may .
as he handed over the reins to successor charles a . co ##rry , steel profits were close to a cyclic ##al peak .
perhaps most important , carl ic ##ah ##n , who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid , was subdued .
he and mr . roderick were even dining out together .
today , mr . co ##rry pre ##side ##s over a company whose fortunes have changed abruptly .
` ` it ' s a baptism of fire for co ##rry , ' ' says one us ##x executive .
the burning question is whether the new chief can parry mr . ic ##ah ##n without being pushed into un ##we ##lco ##me moves .
mr . co ##rry might have to di ##sm ##em ##ber the company more than he wants to .
and he managed to fen ##d off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the inter ##lo ##per .
over dinners at new york ' s sky club and links club restaurants , the steel executive and the big investor talked steel , international trade and thoroughbred horses .
he was shocked , associates say , to learn of mr . ic ##ah ##n ' s new takeover threat .
- l ##rb - both men declined to be interviewed for this article . - rr ##b -
but the fiercely competitive mr . co ##rry quickly showed he ' s no push ##over .
he huddled with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his opponent .
now , it ' s mr . ic ##ah ##n ' s move .
will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of us ##x into separate oil and steel companies ?
given the weakness of the junk - bond market , can he finance a buy - out ?
the 57 - year - old tax attorney never even as ##pired to the job of chief executive .
but after joining the tax department of a us ##x subsidiary 30 years ago , he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46 .
for years , he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms , wearing a hat to work because everyone else did .
` ` i was never a rebel , ' ' he said in an earlier interview .
yet , the una ##ss ##uming mr . co ##rry helped chart us ##x ' s transition from big steel to big oil .
he served as mr . roderick ' s front man in tense negotiations for the 1982 purchase of marathon oil for $ 5 . 9 billion .
mr . co ##rry also ruled that all board meetings would be held in pittsburgh instead of new york or find ##lay , ohio , marathon ' s home .
the executive recalls mr . co ##rry whispering to him and others , ` ` remember , this was dave ' s deal . ' '
mr . co ##rry expected the texas oil & gas sale to delight mr . ic ##ah ##n by addressing his concern about boost ##ing shareholder value .
that would leave us ##x with marathon , its steel mills and its diversified business segment , which includes , among other things , mineral and transportation products .
some spec ##ulate that mr . co ##rry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price .
the problem is that mr . ic ##ah ##n is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring us ##x than mr . co ##rry had planned .
mr . ic ##ah ##n advocates the sale of the company ' s steel operations , and mr . co ##rry does n ' t necessarily disagree .
in the past five years , us ##x has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs .
but the short - term outlook is so - so .
it is n ' t surprising that mess ##rs . roderick and co ##rry view steel so differently .
moreover , the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to us ##x may be gone , for now .
` ` the time has passed for us to spin off steel , ' ' either in a public offering or to a buyer , one executive contend ##s .
that would leave us ##x essentially an oil company with marathon as its core .
marathon has benefited from higher crude - oil prices and strong demand for refined products .
oil has long been mr . co ##rry ' s pet .
should us ##x be left with only marathon , mr . co ##rry might well feel pushed to scout out other energy companies .
however , even us ##x executives who work closely with him are n ' t sure about his long - term goals .
` ` i do n ' t think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go , ' ' one says .
right now , the executive adds , ` ` he wants to continue to focus on paying down ' ' us ##x ' s debt by selling assets .
when negotiating , mr . co ##rry played his cards close to the vest .
` ` what he really wanted to know was about a particular company , but you did n ' t know that .
` ` it ' s part of the capitalist ##ic market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought , ' ' he said .
us ##x , he noted , was formed 88 years ago , ` ` by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies . . . .
people got rich through takeover ##s in those days , as they do today . ' '

sears , roe ##buck & co . is struggling as it enters the critical christmas season .
but the news was even worse for sears ' s core u . s . retail ##ing operation , the largest in the nation .
sears said its u . s . stores had a loss of $ 6 . 9 million , their first deficit for the period in more than five years .
analysts estimated that sales at u . s . stores declined in the quarter , too .
under the new approach , sears set prices that were somewhere between its old ` ` regular ' ' and ` ` sale ' ' prices .
the company said it would resort far less often to slash ##ing prices to woo shop ##pers .
sears officials insist they do n ' t intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results .
the new pricing strategy ` ` is working , ' ' the spokesman asserted .
but analysts say sears faces an especially da ##unt ##ing challenge on the eve of the christmas shopping season .
` ` sears is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values . ' '
the company is highlighting more special deals in its advertising and stores , and it ' s offering to def ##er finance charges on certain big - ticket items .
sears is also stepping up its television ads and changing its message .
' ' by lowering prices throughout its stores , she says , ` ` sears has the right idea . ' '
but the ad also mentions sears ' s sales - - a topic that the retailer has avoided since switching to everyday pricing .
just 5 % of the respondents mentioned brands in september , up slightly from 2 % in march .
only 2 % of the people in september cited sears ' s ` ` friendly personnel . ' '
` ` you see some improvement in these other areas , but it ' s a very small and slow process . ' '
net income at sears ' s merchandise group , which includes international and credit card operations , as well as u . s . stores , fell 25 % .
sears said claims from the storm , as expected , reduced its third - quarter net by $ 80 million , or 23 cents a share .
all ##sta ##te is expected to absorb another big hit in the fourth quarter as claims pour in from the san francisco earthquake .
but a spokesman said the quake wo n ' t have as big a financial impact on all ##sta ##te as hurricane hugo did .
profit at sears ' s cold ##well banker real estate group nearly quad ##rup ##led to $ 81 . 2 million because of gains on sales of property .
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , sears shares closed at $ 40 . 50 , up 87 . 5 cents .
the imports , totaling 98 . 5 million barrels , were 11 % lower than august levels .
imports of crude from the middle east grew 17 % from year - earlier levels , and southeast asian crude imports grew 43 % .
while mid ##ea ##st crude imports were higher compared with year - earlier levels , they fell 18 % compared with august imports .
southeast asian crude imports , however , were 3 . 6 % higher than august .
in houston , we have seen how bad the housing problem can become .
unused houses deter ##ior ##ate rapidly , affecting the value of nearby homes ; in a domino effect , the entire neighborhood can fall victim .
at this stage some people just ` ` walk away ' ' from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value .
but most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments - - they chose not to do so .
the problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions - - in small - scale experiments .
3 - rr ##b - develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the rent ##er .
an o ##cc ##up ##ant will , in most every case , be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house .
in this way , the house is not dumped on to a g ##lu ##tted market .
the unemployment rate was by far the highest in the southern , so - called me ##zzo ##gio ##rno region .
the southern unemployment rate rose to 21 . 3 % in july from 21 . 2 % in april and from 20 . 6 % a year earlier .
ist ##at said 36 ##9 , 000 more people were employed in july than in april .
revenue rose to $ 4 . 45 billion from $ 4 . 15 billion .
in new york stock exchange composite trading , x ##ero ##x closed at $ 62 . 75 a share , up $ 1 .
operating - profit margins slipped almost 18 % , to 4 . 3 % of sales , the analyst noted .
` ` they are holding their own in a weak market , and the restructuring is working , ' ' he says .
in the quarter , the cr ##um & forster insurance unit reported $ 200 million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations .
the subsidiary also increased reserves by $ 140 million , however , and set aside an additional $ 25 million for claims connected with hurricane hugo .
revenue rose 7 . 6 % to $ 12 . 97 billion from $ 12 . 05 billion .
most analysts had expected a sharpe ##r decline after the steep rise in august .
moreover , a recent government report showing widespread lay ##offs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl .
but many economists pointed to a 1 . 8 % september rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category .
she added , however : ` ` it is not robust by any means . ' '
while a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up .
without the increase in defense booking ##s , september orders would have plum ##met ##ed 3 . 9 % .
analysts were most un ##sett ##led by evidence the back ##log of orders at factories is slipping .
in july un ##fi ##lled orders grew 1 % .
` ` it means we ' re eating into the bread that keeps us going .
that is a little disturbing , ' ' ms . klein ##man said .
such steep drops in a category seen as a bar ##ometer of business investment would custom ##ari ##ly be grave news for the economy .
now at least there are question marks about that , and without any question the pace of growth has slowed .
the buy - back , coupled with a nearly completed earlier purchase of 20 million shares , would reduce shares outstanding by more than 26 % .
the norfolk , va . , company has 172 . 2 million shares outstanding .
a spoke ##sw ##oman said the company will finance the buy - back with cash on hand , borrowing and ` ` cash norfolk expects to generate . ' '
analysts said they expected the action , and investors app ##lau ##ded the move .
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , norfolk southern shares closed at $ 37 . 875 , up $ 1 . 125 .
still , analysts do n ' t expect the buy - back to significantly affect per - share earnings in the short term .
` ` the impact wo n ' t be that great , ' ' said graeme lid ##ger ##wood of first boston corp .
that is in part because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding , she said .
longer term , however , the buy - back is expected to increase earnings , especially after 1990 , mrs . lid ##ger ##wood said .
under the program , norfolk plans to acquire shares in the open market .
under the earlier plan , norfolk was authorized in 1987 to buy up to 20 million shares .
john b . cu ##rc ##io , 55 years old , resigned as chairman of this diesel truck manufacturer , effective upon appointment of a successor .

oddly , though , on the very same page you printed a comment that addresses one of the most serious short ##coming ##s of the american education system .
unfortunately , the comment was buried in another article , so it could not stand out in an education context .

the appointment increased the number of directors to 10 , three of whom are company employees .
until 1980 , when japan joined the $ 10 , 000 per capita g ##np club of the advanced countries , it was a model developing nation .
the government built ports , bridges , highways , schools , hospitals and railways .
the standard of living has increased steadily over the past 40 years ; more than 90 % of the people consider themselves middle class .
the people have given their leading and only credible political party , the liberal democratic party , clear and un ##int ##er ##rup ##ted power for those 40 years .
the ld ##p won by a landslide in the last election , in july 1986 .
but less than two years later , the ld ##p started to cr ##umble , and dissent rose to unprecedented heights .
the symptoms all point to one thing : japan does not have a modern government .
it also allows people to buy the best and the cheap ##est goods from anywhere in the world .
the japanese government does n ' t allow this .
the ministry of agriculture and fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions .
the ministry of health and welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people .
the ministry of education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers , and certainly does not act on behalf of students .
the ministry of transportation serves the industry , certainly not the passengers who must pay extra ##ord ##ina ##rily high prices .
this ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstanding ##s and mis ##per ##ception ##s that are at the root of japan ' s deteriorating image .
instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries .
all this illustrates that japanese ministries still have a ` ` provider ' ' mental ##ity ; they do not serve the people , and particularly not consumers .
they serve the industries and the special - interest groups .
the rest of the world accepted such methods when japan was developing .
japanese put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing pay ##che ##cks .
the diet plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureau ##cratic system .
most bills are drafted by bureau ##crats , not politicians .
so most bills are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties .
a recent example is the 3 % consumption tax on all commercial activities .
this makes enormous sense in japan , where direct tax accounts for more than 70 % of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair .
if you are a sal ##ari ##ed man , am ##en ! 100 % captured .
if you are a retailer , 50 % , and a farmer , 30 % .
to correct this inequality , most people would have favored an indirect tax , like the consumption tax .
but the bill was passed without debate in the diet , in the absence of the opposition .
as a result , the japanese people did n ' t know what to expect when the new law was introduced on april 1 .
they were frustrated by the longer queue ##s at the cash ##ier and the small coins given as change .
all of a sudden , prices were no longer in denominations of 100 or 200 .
while people were jing ##ling their change , the ld ##p politicians were caught in scandals .
taken by surprise , the socialist party is busy changing its doctrines .
it ' s now ok to deal with the u . s . , but not the soviet union .
the u . s . - japan security treaty can continue , sort of .
against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the socialist party the ld ##p has been paralyzed .
if the ld ##p , as currently composed , ca n ' t make the transformation , then it should split into two parties .
one party could stand for consumer interests , small government , free trade and global ##ism to put japan clearly among the most developed and open countries .
the other party could continue on the traditional track of the ld ##p , representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protection ##ism .
the ld ##p must make a decision immediately ; lower house elections must take place before june .
we must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real - estate and financial markets .
at the most there is only nine months before the ld ##p fuse burns out .
mr . oh ##ma ##e is managing director of mc ##kins ##ey & co . in japan .
early this century , diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the nam ##ib desert meets the atlantic ocean was a day at the beach .
men would crawl in the sand looking for shiny stones .
it was as easy as collecting sea shells at malibu .
men are still comb ##ing the beach with shovel ##s and hand brushes , searching for that unusual glint .
oh yes , the atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards .
` ` if there ' s diamonds out there , we ' ll get to them , ' ' says les johns , de beers ' s engineering manager .
while other mines might yield more cara ##ts , a higher percentage of them go to industrial use .
since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault , it has been turned into one .
today , no one gets in or out of the restricted area without de beers ' s sting ##y approval .
the mining zone has thus remained one of the most des ##olate places in africa .
ghost towns dot the nam ##ib dunes , proving diamonds are n ' t forever .
or ##an ##je ##mund , the mine headquarters , is a lonely corporate oasis of 9 , 000 residents .
on most days , the desert ' s heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag .
the wind , stinging with sand , never seems to stop .
still , miners from all parts of namibia as well as professional staff from de beers ' s head offices in south africa and london keep coming .
and or ##an ##je ##mund boasts attractions besides diamonds .
there are six video rental shops , three restaurants , one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling .
the pride of or ##an ##je ##mund is the 18 - hole golf course - - with the largest sand trap in the world .
` ` nothing is too good for our golf course , ' ' says tony george , a mining engineer .
huge machines that look as though they came from the star wars desert - battle scene lumber among the dunes .
then there is the art ##ific ##al sea wall , 600 yards long and 60 yards thick , ju ##tting into the ocean .
made of sand , it receives around - the - clock maintain ##ence against the batter ##ing waves .
when the mining in front of the wall is complete , it is moved northward .
a companion jett ##y that helps hold back the sea looks like a rust ##ing junk ##yard .
engineers first used concrete blocks to bo ##lster the barrier , but the ocean tossed them aside like drift ##wood .
then someone decided to try broken - down earth ##mo ##ving equipment that , in ##ex ##pl ##ica ##bly , held against the waves .
` ` the cater ##pi ##llar people are n ' t too happy when they see their equipment used like that , ' ' shrugs mr . george .
` ` they figure it ' s not a very good ad ##vert . ' '
labor ##ing in blue and gray overall ##s , they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out cr ##evic ##es , and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds .
but should they spy one , the company will pay a bonus equal to one - third its value .
still , employees do occasionally try to smug ##gle out a gem or two .
one man wrapped several diamonds in the knot of his tie .
another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe .

disaster states are n ' t jumping to raise taxes for relief and recovery .
just after hurricane hugo battered south carolina , some officials talked of perhaps adding a penny to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes .
gov . campbell responded , ` ` they ' re mentioning rope when there ' s been a hanging in the family . ' '
a spokesman says the governor believes he can avoid increases by relying on federal aid and shifting funds in state programs .
still , hugo ' s impact may revive unsuccessful proposals to give local governments authority to levy sales taxes .
a spokesman for north carolina gov . martin says hugo has n ' t prompted proposals for state or local increases .
california , where earthquake damage may top $ 5 billion , plans a special legislative session .
legislators are talking about temporary rises in sales or gasoline taxes , although gov . de ##uk ##me ##jian says they should be a last resort .
needs are n ' t clear , and the state constitution makes increasing taxes and spending very difficult .
but some legislators think the time may be ripe to rev ##ise the constitution .

if you assign your income to another , you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor , even if indirectly .
the conference opened monday with glowing reports about consumer magazines ' growth in circulation and advertising revenue in the past year .
` ` how do readers feel about the magazine ?
research does n ' t tell us whether people actually do read the magazines they sub ##scribe to . ' '
reuben mark , chief executive of col ##gate - palm ##oli ##ve , said ad ##vert ##iser ##s lack detailed demographic and geographic breakdown ##s of magazines ' audiences .
` ` we need research that convinces us that magazines are a real value in reader ' s lives , that readers are really involved . ' '
the critics also lamb ##ast ##ed the magazine industry for something executives often are very proud of : the growth in magazine titles during the 1980s .
` ` niche - it ##is fragments our advertising dollars , ' ' said mr . laude ##r .
` ` we are being over - magazine ##d .
we are constantly faced with deciding which partnerships - lc ##b - with magazines - rc ##b - we can keep . ' '
` ` readers do n ' t want to face all those ad pages at the front of a magazine , ' ' he said .
magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down .
` ` we spend a fortune on research information , ' ' said steve bu ##rz ##on , publisher of meredith corp . ' s metropolitan home .
` ` but ad ##vert ##iser ##s would n ' t think of it , ' ' she said .
revenue more than doubled to $ 2 . 62 billion from $ 1 . 29 billion .
` ` the earnings were fine and above expectations , ' ' said michael w . blu ##ms ##tein , an analyst at first boston corp .
but some analysts say sal ##omo ##n has turned the corner .
` ` the market has been overly harsh to them . ' '
analysts say investors remain ski ##tti ##sh toward sal ##omo ##n because of its volatile earnings .
in the first quarter , sal ##omo ##n had a record loss of $ 28 million on revenue of $ 1 . 54 billion .
but in the second quarter , sal ##omo ##n posted a record $ 253 million net on revenue of $ 2 . 33 billion .
for the real estate industry , a watch ##word for the 1990s will be buy , more than build .
the ul ##i is a non - profit research and education group based in washington , d . c . , with 14 , 000 members nationwide .
with the market over ##bu ##il ##t , builders are finding limited opportunities and increased risks .
developers and money managers are looking for bargain ##s among the thousands of financially troubled properties around the country .
real estate professionals now often bill themselves as ` ` turn ##around experts ' ' and ` ` workout specialists . ' '
developers are also eyeing the real estate portfolio ##s of major corporations .
some plan to pursue foreign development ventures , mostly in europe .
and other developers may shift from commercial to residential development in the u . s . .
so developers are saying they will look into distressed properties .
they ' ll go into someone else ' s pasture as long as it ' s greene ##r than the one they ' re in now . ' '
developers are also forming more joint ventures with pension funds and insurance companies that can finance big projects .
the builders are more willing to give up some equity and rely on management and consulting fees to stay afl ##oat in the soft market .
` ` they are growing more pr ##ag ##matic about their role . ' '
real estate firms are also using their alliances with financial institutions to ama ##ss acquisition funds .
but experts say that when it comes to distressed properties , finding diamonds in the rough is n ' t easy .
and to succeed in the turn ##around business , he says , developers may have to put in a lot of money and time .
finding pension funds and other sources willing to invest is a high priority .
u . s . and soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further tha ##w in u . s . - soviet relations .
he added that it likely will have a ` ` mu ##lit ##ip ##lier effect ' ' in stimulating further trade between the two countries .
the project will be the largest u . s . - backed joint venture to be undertaken in the soviet union in recent years .
one of the hotels , to be called the she ##rat ##on moscow , will have 450 rooms and will cost an estimated $ 75 million to build .
the six - story hotel will be on go ##rky street and initially will cater mostly to business travelers .
it will have a russian tavern , an english pub , a disco ##the ##que and japanese and italian restaurants , according to a she ##rat ##on announcement .
the second hotel , to be called the budapest hotel , is to be constructed at a site even closer to red square .
details about its size and cost have n ' t yet been determined .
the soviet owners will be moss ##ov ##ie ##t , moscow ' s city governing body , and aero ##fl ##ot , the soviet national airline .
but some u . s . companies are negotiating projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched .
she ##rat ##on and pan am said they are assured under the soviet joint - venture law that they can rep ##at ##ria ##te profits from their hotel venture .
he said the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route just ##ifies a major investment in new high - standard moscow hotels .

but no matter how much japan gets under our skin , we ' ll still have mom and apple pie .
a japanese apple called the fuji is crop ##ping up in orchards the way honda ##s did on u . s . roads .
some fruit vision ##aries say the fuji could someday tumble the red delicious from the top of america ' s apple heap .
it certainly wo n ' t get there on looks .
to hear most u . s . grow ##ers tell it , we ' d still be in paradise if the serpent had prof ##fer ##ed one to eve .
` ` it does n ' t look nice on the outside while getting meal ##y inside . ' '
mr . au ##vil , razor sharp at 83 , has picked and packed a z ##ill ##ion peck ##s of apples over the past 65 years .
it did , shaking the apple establishment to its roots .
now , even more radical changes seem af ##oot as the grand old maverick of american apples plays the role of hiroshi apples ##eed .
` ` the fuji is going to be no . 1 to replace the red delicious , ' ' he says .
the delicious he ##ge ##mony wo n ' t end anytime soon .
new apple trees grow slowly , and the red delicious is almost as en ##tre ##nched as mom .
its roots are patriotic - - with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near peru , iowa , to be exact .
for more than 50 years , it has been the apple of our eye .
more than twice as many red delicious apples are grown as the golden variety , america ' s no . 2 apple .
the g ##lu ##t and con ##se ##quent lower prices , combined with cancer fears , was a very serious blow to grow ##ers .
one may be william bro ##der ##ick , a sterling , mass . , grow ##er .
` ` this is beautiful stuff , ' ' he says , looking rue ##fully at big boxes of just - picked red delicious next to his barn .
` ` but i ' m going to lose $ 50 , 000 to $ 60 , 000 on it .
i ' m going to have to get another job this year just to eat . ' '
besides rotten prices , he has been hit recently by hail , a bark - ni ##bbling horde of mice , fungi and bugs .
` ` i ' ve got 70 kinds of apples .
here ' s a walt ##ana , ' ' he ex ##claim ##s , picking one off a tree .
he bites it , scowl ##s and throws it down . ` `
supermarkets are getting into the variety act , too .
they still buy apples mainly for big , red good looks - - that ' s why so many taste like wood ##chu ##cks ' punching bags .
the fuji is a product of met ##ic ##ulous japanese po ##mo ##logical engineering , which foster ##ed it 50 years ago at a government research orchard .
japanese researchers have bred dozens of strains of fuji ##s to hon ##e its color , taste and shelf life .
now the best of them age as gracefully as gran ##nies , the industry ' s gold standard for st ##ora ##bility .
the u . s . department of agriculture estimates that this year americans will eat about 40 % more fresh apples per capita than the japanese .
the fuji is still small potatoes in the u . s . , sold mainly in fruit boutique ##s .
but in california , says craig ito , a fuji - apple grow ##er , ` ` there ' s a fuji apple cult .
once somebody eats one , they get hooked . ' '
mr . au ##vil , the washington grow ##er , says that he could sell fuji ##s to taiwan buyers at $ 40 a box if he had them .
- l ##rb - taiwan already is a big import ##er of fuji ##s from other places , he adds . - rr ##b -
but his first crop wo n ' t be picked till next year .
` ` i expect to see the demand exceed supply for fuji ##s for the next 10 to 15 years , ' ' he adds .
washington red delicious , by the way , are whole ##sal ##ing for less than $ 10 a box these days .
mr . au ##vil sees fuji ##s , in part , as striking a blow against the per ##version of u . s . apples by supermarkets .
` ` when the chain stores took over , there was no longer a connection between grow ##er and consumer .
a guy is sitting up in an office deciding what you ' re going to eat . ' '
after all , until the 1950s even the red delicious was a firm , del ##ect ##able morse ##l .
then , as grow ##ers bred them more for looks , and to satisfy supermarket chains ' demands of long - term storage , the red went into decline .
now , those red apple ##like things stores sell in summer are fruit ##bow ##l lovely , but usually not good eating .
they do deserve respect , however - - they are almost a year old , probably equal to about 106 in human years .
the fuji , to be sure , has b ##lem ##ish ##es too .
it ripe ##ns later than most apples , and growing it in u . s . areas with chilly autumn ##s may be tricky .
moreover , the fr ##ump ##y fuji must compete with an increasingly doll ##ed ##up delicious .
and he had n ' t used hormones , which many grow ##ers employ to el ##onga ##te their delicious apples for greater eye appeal .
still , mr . au ##vil points out , gran ##nies became popular without big , red looks , so why not fuji ##s ?
he sees a shift in american values - - at least regarding apples - - toward more emphasis on substance and less on g ##litz .
` ` taste has finally come to the fore , ' ' he says .
the maker of engineered materials has acquired more than 2 . 7 million shares under the program .
the suit sets the firms ' liability at more than $ 185 million .
the firms have all said that west virginia ' s suit is without merit .
on friday , the firms filed a suit against west virginia in new york state court asking for a dec ##lar ##atory judgment abs ##ol ##ving them of liability .
the suits relate to a $ 200 million loss , disclosed in december , that was suffered by west virginia ' s consolidated investment pool .
the pool invested idle cash for many state agencies and local governments .
few people are aware that the federal government lend ##s almost as much money as it borrow ##s .
federal credit programs date back to the new deal , and were meant to break even financially .
as we will see , many of these obligations do n ' t show up as part of the federal deficit .
but recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control .
student loan default ##s remain high at about 12 % , and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mis ##mana ##gement .
default ##s on veterans affairs loan guarantees have quad ##rup ##led in the past eight years .
although external events have contributed to the mora ##ss , the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs .
there is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program .
if the program is meant to provide a subsidy , collecting the debt defeats the original goal .
thus , sub ##si ##di ##zed loans tend to turn into give ##away programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time .
to avoid this problem , government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect .
in contrast , credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets .
for example , legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibit ##ed the supply of credit to the agricultural sector .
farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lend ##able funds .
however , this in no way just ##ifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans .
credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy .
the program provides highly sub ##si ##di ##zed loans to any student whose family earn ##s less than a particular amount .
high default rates , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high .
families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates .
while the student was in school , interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance .
this program , combined with cash grants to needy students , would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended ben ##ef ##icia ##ries .
given the structure of most credit programs , it is surprising that default rates are not even higher .
guarantee rates are typically 100 % , giving lend ##ers little reason to screen customers carefully .
reducing those rates moderately - l ##rb - say , to 75 % - rr ##b - would still provide substantial assistance to borrow ##ers .
but it would also encourage lend ##ers to choose more credit ##worthy customers , and go a long way toward reducing default ##s .
for example , the small business administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its preferred lend ##ers ' program .
borrow ##ers ' incentives are equally sk ##ew ##ed .
since the government has a di ##sma ##l record of collecting bad debts , the costs to the borrow ##er of default ##ing are usually low .
in addition , it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off .
3 . record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget .
by converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee , the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit .
predict ##ably , guarantees outstanding have risen by $ 130 billion since 1985 , while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $ 30 billion .
the true budget ##ary cost of a credit subsidy is the discount ##ed value of the net costs to government .
many agencies roll over their debt , paying off del ##in ##quent loans by issuing new loans , or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans .
in any case , they avoid having to write off the loans .
more seriously , fm ##ha has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value .
until gao ' s recent audit , f ##ha books had not been subject to a complete external audit in 15 years .
the administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices , including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audit ##s .
establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises , provide better information for loan sales and budget ##ing decisions , and reduce fraud .
government lending was not intended to be a way to ob ##fus ##cate spending figures , hide fraudulent activity , or provide large subsidies .
the reforms described above would provide a more limited , but clearer , safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lend ##er .
without such reforms , credit programs will continue to be a large - scale , high - risk proposition for taxpayers .

president bush is considering casting a line - item veto as a test to determine whether the courts will rule that he has such authority .
he has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending .
such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from congress that would clarify whether a president already has such power .

the proposal rei ##tera ##tes the u . s . desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade - di ##stor ##ting subsidies on farm products .
but it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved .
unlike the earlier u . s . farm - trade proposal which struck european countries as too extreme , the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver .
it also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports .

per - share figures have been adjusted for a 2 - for - 1 stock split effective oct . 20 .
sales increased 6 % to $ 5 . 58 billion from $ 5 . 27 billion .
excluding the gain , p & g ' s earnings were close to analysts ' predictions of about $ 1 . 40 a share for the quarter .
wall street had expected a modest rise in the company ' s domestic sales and earnings , and more substantial increases in overseas results .
one factor helping sales and earnings was a 3 % price rise for most p & g products , except coffee , analysts said .
he figures p & g will expand its personal - care product line in japan to ` ` continue that momentum . ' '
for fiscal 1990 , analysts expect p & g ' s sales to continue to grow , with earnings climbing between 15 % and 20 % .
` ` but i ' m recognizing there ' s a good chance they ' ll do a bit better than that , ' ' she says .
in fiscal 1989 , p & g earned $ 3 . 56 a share , adjusted for the stock split .
because of his remarkable success turning around p & g ' s international operations , analysts have high hopes for his tenure .
the program has even been called upon to create ` ` safe ' ' white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority .
the new goal of the voting rights act - - more minorities in political office - - is lau ##dable .
for the political process to work , all citizens , regardless of race , must feel represented .
one essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency .
as is , blacks constitute 12 % of the population , but fewer than 2 % of elected leaders .
but racial gerry ##man ##der ##ing is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal .
it is a quick fix for a complex problem .
examples of the di ##vis ##ive effects of racial gerry ##man ##der ##ing can be seen in two cities - - new york and birmingham , ala .
when they re ##app ##ort ##ion their districts after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue .
sometime in 1991 , as soon as the 1990 census becomes available , a red ##ist ##ricting panel will red ##ra ##w the city council district lines .
blacks and hispanic ##s currently make up 38 % of the city ' s population and hold only 25 % of the seats on the council .
often they have found that the relevant issue is not race , but rather housing , crime prevention or education .
the unusual situation in birmingham vivid ##ly illustrates the di ##vis ##ive consequences of carving out safe districts for racial minorities .
in birmingham , which is 57 % black , whites are the minority .
richard ar ##rington , birmingham ' s black mayor , lame ##nted the consequences .
two hundred years ago , critics of the new united states constitution warned that the electoral districts for congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests .
a small farmer and a sea ##port merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman , they said .
but james madison ref ##uted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatise ##s ever written , no . 10 of the federal ##ist papers .
madison explained that a representative ' s duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good .
madison ' s noble and un ##ifying vision of the representative still can guide us .

this trend appears to be especially true at general motors corp . , which used both dealer and consumer incentives to ign ##ite sales in august and september .
gm also had di ##sma ##l results in the first 10 days of the month , while other auto makers reported mixed results .
the sales are being dragged down by a g ##lu ##t of 1989 vehicles , said joel pit ##co ##ff , a ford analyst .
the earlier use of incentives depleted the market of ` ` sc ##ave ##nger ##s ' ' for bargain - basement 1989 cars , he said .

business had been fairly strong until hurricane hugo hit the area , but has been down since .
chrysler corp . also hit the rocks in mid - october .
but sales of domestic cars and trucks at nissan motor corp . rose 26 . 1 % to 5 , 65 ##1 .
a nissan spokesman attributed the increase to the use of incentives this year and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales .
toyota motor corp . , which opened a plant in georgetown , ky . , last year , saw sales triple to 6 , 256 vehicles .
a - totals include only vehicle sales reported in the period .
x - there were 9 selling days in the most recent period and 9 a year earlier .
percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume .
the coincidence might lead to the conclusion that short - sellers bet heavily on that day that ot ##c stocks would decline further .
as it happens , the nas ##da ##q composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge .
generally , it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade .
short interest , which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold , but not yet replaced , can be a bad - expectations bar ##ometer for many stocks .
big stocks with large short interest gains as of oct . 13 included first executive , intel , camp ##eau and lin broadcasting .
short interest in first executive , an insurance issue , rose 55 % to 3 . 8 million .
intel ' s short interest jumped 42 % , while camp ##eau ' s increased 62 % .
intel makes semiconductor ##s and camp ##eau operates department - store chains and is strained for cash .
merit ##or savings again had the dubious honor of being the ot ##c stock with the biggest short interest position on nas ##da ##q .
first executive and troubled valley national corp . of arizona were next in line .
short selling is n ' t necessarily bad for the overall market .
short ##ed shares must eventually be replaced through buying .
in addition , changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by ar ##bit ##rage .
for example , an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and short ##ing the stock of the other .
two big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge .
short interest in the american deposit ##ary receipts of jaguar , the target of both ford motor and general motors , more than doubled .
among bigger ot ##c stocks , the figures represent 2 . 05 days of average daily volume , compared with 2 . 14 days in september .
from the sept . 30 - oct . 4 issue of the economist :
what defeated general ao ##un was not only the weight of the syrian army .
the weight of lebanon ' s history was also against him ; and it is a history israel is in danger of repeating .
like lebanon , and however unfair ##ly , israel is regarded by the arab world as a colonial abe ##rra ##tion .
its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the palestinians .
like lebanon , israel is being remade by demo ##graphy .
in greater israel more than half the children under six are muslims .
within 25 years jews will probably be the minority .
but that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of general ao ##un .

as usual , the over - the - counter market ' s biggest technology stocks were hardest hit .

other active stocks included jaguar , whose american deposit ##ary receipts added 1 \ / 8 to 11 1 \ / 4 .
mr . da ##pu ##zzo also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scar ##ing away retail and foreign investors .
the vol ##ati ##lity inherent in program trading troubled other traders , too .
they do n ' t like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically .
market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when im ##balance ##s occur .
that means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers ab ##ound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will .
in such an environment , a market maker can absorb huge losses .
the market makers say they are n ' t comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can tumble quickly .
the situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly , ex ##ace ##rba ##ting the rise and fall in stock prices during program - dominated trading .

without question , something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the pol ##it ##buro .
as it bids for new agreements , new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world , the soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem .
so after 70 years , it is confess ##ing the obvious , hoping to be believed about other things .
if the soviets want to be believed , they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious .

man ##ville said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value .
it said it would purchase the stock at market price .
man ##ville and a spoke ##sw ##oman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision has n ' t been made .
` ` we are considering that offer along with all other alternatives , ' ' the trust spoke ##sw ##oman said .
` ` we need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our ben ##ef ##icia ##ries . ' '
the trust also owns half of man ##ville ' s 48 million common shares outstanding .
but it initially was funded with about $ 76 ##5 million and may soon face a cash crunch .
since most of its assets are tied to man ##ville , a forest and building products concern , the trust might also want to divers ##ify its holdings .
a man ##ville spokesman would n ' t elaborate on the proposed changes .
but he said they are ` ` to a large degree , house ##keeping , ' ' although some may generate some disagreement .
the $ 2 . 25 billion value claimed by northeast , based in hartford , con ##n . , is the highest yet given to a bid .
some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow , a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge .
a hearing is set for nov . 15 , but participants do n ' t expect a resolution until july 1990 .
under the new northeast utilities plan , it would pay $ 1 . 65 billion in cash to creditors and assume $ 100 million in pollution control bonds .
the biggest change in northeast ' s offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shri ##ft previously .
northeast ' s previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ 165 million .
in addition , northeast promised the state of new hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5 . 5 % annually for seven years .
its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on sea ##brook operations and other con ##ting ##encies .
officials of ps of new hampshire could n ' t be reached for comment .
the company has filed an internal reorganization plan it valued at $ 2 . 2 billion that would require 5 . 5 % rate increases .
that plan would leave existing preferred shareholders with at least a 41 % stake and give common shareholders as little as 13 % .
the state of new hampshire has favored that plan .
tons of del ##ect ##ably rotting potatoes , barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state ' s buyers away .
many a pig ##let wo n ' t be born as a result , and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop .
but with inflation raging , grain in the barn will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank .
once again , the indo ##mit ##able peasant holds poland ' s future in his hands .
until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system , even solidarity ' s sympathetic new government wo n ' t win him over .
factory workers on strike knocked poland ' s communist bosses off balance last year ; this year , it was the farmers who brought them down .
in june , farmers held onto meat , milk and grain , waiting for july ' s usual state - directed price rises .
the farmers ran a boycott , and meat disappeared from the shops .
on aug . 1 , the state tore up its controls , and food prices leaped .
but by the time solidarity took office in september , the damage was done .
` ` shortage ##fl ##ation , ' ' as economists have come to call it , had gone hyper .
the cost of raising a pig kept bound ##ing ahead of the return for selling one .
here , they are searching for a higher price .
` ` of course it ' s better to sell private , ' ' he says , as the butcher tr ##und ##les away .
` ` why should anybody want to sell to them ? ' '
the young farmer makes money on the few hog ##s he sells here .
he wo n ' t for long , because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up .
` ` there ' s no feed , ' ' he says .
` ` you ca n ' t buy anything nowadays .
i do n ' t know why . ' '
his truck is parked across the field , in a row of grain sellers .
the farmer at the next truck shouts , ` ` wheat !
a heavy , ke ##rch ##ie ##fed woman runs a handful through her fingers , and counts him out a pile of z ##lot ##ys .
` ` country people breed pigs , ' ' says mr . cho ##jn ##owski , leaning against the back of his truck .
` ` they ca n ' t buy feed from the state .
some state middle ##men come to buy from me .
on this morning , he does n ' t sell much in ra ##d ##zy ##min , either .
at closing time , farmers cart out most of what they cart ##ed in .
a private market like this just is n ' t big enough to absorb all that business .
the hulk of stalin ##ism , it seems , will not quickly cr ##umble away .
state mono ##pol ##ies will keep on st ##if ##ling trade , ` ` free ' ' prices or not , until something else replaces them .
the communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalist ##ic structures ever arose here .
building them now will require under ##gi ##rdi ##ng from the west , and removal of political dead ##wood , a job that solidarity has barely started .
but polish agriculture does possess one great asset already : the private farmer .
` ` there are a lot of them , and they have property . ' '
polish peasants , spur ##ning the collect ##iv ##izer ##s , were once a source of shame to orthodox communists .
now , among communist reformer ##s , they are objects of envy .
food is the reformer ' s top priority , the key to popular support .
as the chinese have shown and the soviets are learning , family farms thrive where collective ##s fail .
ownership , it seems , is the best fe ##rti ##lizer .
poland ' s 2 . 7 million small private farms cover 76 % of its arab ##le land .
like the roman catholic church , the polish peasant is a pillar of the nation .
try as they might , the communists could neither replace nor break him .
c ##zes ##law p ##ys ##z ##kiewicz owns 30 acres in 14 scattered scrap ##s .
he grows rye and potatoes for a few hen ##s , five cows and 25 pig ##lets .
in patch ##ed pants and torn shoes , he stands in his barn ##yard eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sar ##don ##ic .
` ` it ' s bad soil , ' ' he says .
then the state put in a reservoir to supply the area with drinking water .
the dam caused the water level to drop in za ##lub ##ice .
mr p ##ys ##z ##kiewicz smiles and his brow fur ##row ##s .
in his lifetime , 47 years , the communists brought electricity to his village and pipe ##d in drinking water from the reservoir .
` ` we wanted them to build a road here , ' ' he says .
` ` they started , and then abandoned it . ' '
a tractor , his only mechanized equipment , stands in front of the pigs ##ty .
even if i had a lot of money , i could n ' t buy what i need . ' '
the farmer can say the same for coal , cement , saw blades .
in poland , only 4 % of all investment goes toward making things farmers want ; in the west , it is closer to 20 % .
the few big state farms take first crack at what does get made .
they use 60 % more fe ##rti ##lizer per acre , twice the high - grade feed .
yet their best bo ##ast is that they produce 32 % of polish pork .
a private farmer never waste ##s anything . ' '
the state quit shoving peasants onto its sub ##si ##di ##zed farms over 30 years ago .
but it never did let up on the pressure .
until recently , a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension .
the pension ' s size still depends on how much produce he sells the state .
his all ##ot ##ment of materials also did , until the state could n ' t hold up its end of that bargain .
when supplies are short , it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain .
a private farmer in poland is free to buy and sell land , hire help , decide what to grow and how to grow it .
he is free to invest in chickens , and to fail for lack of chicken wire .
he has plenty of freedom - - but no choices .
` ` i ' m on my own land , ' ' mr . p ##ys ##z ##kiewicz says .
` ` i do n ' t have to listen to what anybody tells me to do . ' '
` ` sometimes , ' ' says his wife , ` ` we ' re happy about that . ' '
by starving the peasant , the communists have starved poland .
villages like za ##lub ##ice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors .
the young leave , especially girls who wo n ' t milk cows by hand .
some men stay , their best friend a bottle of vodka , but two million acres have gone fall ##ow .
without machines , good farms ca n ' t get bigger .
so the potato crop , once 47 million tons , is down to 35 million .
meat consumption is at 1979 ' s level , pork production at 1973 ' s , milk output at 1960 ' s .
if a food crisis und ##id the communists , a food revolution will make solidarity .
the potential is displayed along every road into warsaw : row upon row of greenhouse ##s , stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners ' wealth .
vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in poland , the pick ##les and sa ##uer ##kra ##ut sublime , the state mono ##pol ##ies long broken .
poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale .
a law went on the books in january that let him smoke bacon without breeding pigs .
` ` i pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees , ' ' he says .
` ` i hire transportation , and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day .
i do n ' t sub ##si ##di ##ze anyone .
if nobody buys , i bring my prices down .
mr . si ##emi ##enas is making a fortune - - $ 10 , 000 a month , he says .
he has bought some trend ##y western clothes , and a green mercedes with an american flag in the window .
but the meat - processing machines he picked up are 50 years old .
` ` i do n ' t want expensive machines .
if the situation changes , i ' ll get stuck with them . ' '
by taking power in a deal with the peasant party ' s one ##time communist st ##oo ##ges , solidarity has sp ##ook ##ed the rural entrepreneur .
rural solidarity objected , to no avail , when solidarity leader le ##ch wales ##a accepted the peasants ' support .
it objected again in september when prime minister tad ##eus ##z ma ##zow ##iec ##ki reluctantly named a peasant party man as his agriculture minister .
both the peasants and rural solidarity are forming new political parties for farmers .
the peasants can make a credible case , against solidarity , that hell - bent reform will drive millions from the land .
next spring , the two will battle in local elections .

a formal house - senate conference is expected to rat ##ify the accord later this week .
sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for friday at mob ##il offices in new orleans and denver .
mob ##il ' s latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil - producing operations .
individuals familiar with mob ##il ' s strategy say that mob ##il is reducing its u . s . work force because of declining u . s . output .
yesterday , mob ##il said domestic exploration and production operations had a $ 16 million loss in the third quarter , while comparable foreign operations earned $ 234 million .
daily output is expected to decline by at least another 500 , 000 barrels next year .
some mob ##il executives were dismay ##ed that a reference to the cut ##backs was included in the earnings report before workers were notified .
one mob ##il executive said that the $ 40 million charge related to the action indicates ` ` a substantial ' ' number of people will be involved .
some will likely be offered se ##verance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations .
the justice department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal judge david sent ##elle recently called a ` ` monster . ' '
needles ##s to say , he was talking about rico .
with its recently revised guidelines for rico , justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors .
the text of the ` ` new policy ' ' guidelines from the criminal division are reprinted nearby .
they strongly suggest that justice ' s prosecution ##s of dr ##ex ##el burnham lambert , michael milk ##en and princeton \ / newport violated notions of fundamental fairness .
justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics .
the new guidelines limit the pre ##tri ##al for ##feit ##ures of assets of rico ##ed defendants and their investors , clients , bankers and others .
this follows earlier new guidelines from the tax division prohibiting princeton \ / newport - like tax cases from mas ##que ##rad ##ing as rico cases .
these changes come a tad late for princeton \ / newport , the first rico ##ed securities firm .
it was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre - trial asset for ##feit ##ure .
prosecutors wanted $ 23 . 8 million in for ##feit ##ure for alleged tax fraud of some $ 400 , 000 .
part of dr ##ex ##el ' s plea was to cut mr . milk ##en loose .
so after all the prosecutor ##ial hoop ##la no one has established what , if anything , dr ##ex ##el did wrong .
but prosecutor ##ial guidelines are effective only if someone at justice is willing and able to supervise hyper ##active prosecutors .
no prosecutor ##ial guidelines , observed or uno ##bs ##erved , limit civil rico cases by plaintiffs for damages .
what now for princeton \ / newport officials , dr ##ex ##el and mr . milk ##en ?
justice should review these cases to see what other prosecutor ##ial abuses may have occurred .
we suspect that justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of rico can guarantee an end to injustice ##s in its name .

yesterday , in composite trading on the american stock exchange , pegasus closed at $ 10 . 125 , up 12 . 5 cents .
now , only god exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into his nature .
but since the time of darwin , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .
are n ' t we , after all , the inevitable cu ##lm ##ination of that state ##ly pageant called evolution ?
now along comes stephen jay gould to dash this flat ##tering illusion .
yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from darwin .
the argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the canadian rockies called the burgess shale .
such an embarrassment of riches was inc ##on ##ce ##iva ##ble to the man who discovered the burgess shale , one charles doo ##lit ##tle wal ##cott .
the received darwin ##ian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design , limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species .
accordingly , the hide ##bound traditional ##ist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the burgess fossils in such a way that they could be shoe ##horn ##ed into familiar categories .
one was so fantastic in appearance , it was dubbed hall ##uc ##igen ##ia .
would that mr . gould ' s minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful .
a good deal of the book is boring , particularly the endless all ##usions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes fest ##oon ##ing the text .
interest picks up , though , when mr . gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the burgess odd ##ities for the theory of evolution .
not long after the appearance of life , evidently , there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth .
' ' so much for survival of the fit ##test .
so much , too , for the notion that we humans triumph ##ed in the darwin ##ian struggle by evolving big brains .
our mammalian forerunner ##s luck ##ed out through the extra ##ter ##rest ##rial impact that did in the dinosaurs because they were small , not smart .
if anyone has difficulty imagining a world in which history went mer ##rily on without us , mr . gould sketches several .
in one , birds are the dominant car ##ni ##vor ##es ; in another the seas ab ##ound with ` ` little penis ##es . ' '
back when the burgess fauna were flourishing , it seems , human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called pi ##kai ##a .
mr . holt is a columnist for the literary review in london .
the justice department scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecution ##s under the federal rack ##ete ##ering law .
the guidelines were distributed to u . s . attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week .
they discourage prosecutors , under certain circumstances , from seeking court orders seizing the assets of rack ##ete ##ering defendants prior to trial .
another provision cl ##ari ##fies certain limits on when prosecutors may use tax - fraud charges as a basis for bringing a rack ##ete ##ering case .
mr . run ##kel declined to spec ##ulate on whether the guidelines would curb rack ##ete ##ering prosecution ##s against corporate defendants .
but mr . run ##kel said the government is n ' t ` ` backing off on these kinds of matters at all .
that leaves the state roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion short .
a sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry .
california ' s so - called gan ##n limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency .
according to a spokesman , the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes .
one immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by gov . de ##uk ##me ##jian .
but the fund ' s size is disputed by mr . brown ' s office , which estimates the fund holds from $ 630 million to $ 800 million .
to push through a sales tax increase , however , the state will have to suspend the gan ##n limit , citing an emergency .
a sales tax increase would require two - thirds approval in both houses of the state ' s legislature .
but others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state ' s earthquake relief tab .
since the late 1970s , california property owners have benefited from a tax roll ##back as a result of a state ballot initiative known as proposition 13 .
the state could also increase gasoline taxes ; every one penny increase in the tax would yield $ 11 million a month .
but some fear imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could under ##cut support among voters for the measure .
not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs .
a board of control spokesman said the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment .

red tape is the bug ##ab ##oo of small business .
yet every business owner has to face the mound of forms and regulations - - and often is the only one available to tackle it .
other law ##makers are busy trying to revive the recently laps ##ed paperwork reduction act , which many feel benefited small enterprises .
thus , optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape - - just as soon as uncle sam gets around to arranging it .
meanwhile , they tackle the mounds of paper - - and fan ##tas ##ize about a dream world where bulk - mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished .
some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose .
they con ##cede that much of the government med ##dling that torment ##s them is essential to the public good , and even to their own businesses .
some grip ##es about red tape are predictable : architects complain about a host of building regulations , auto leasing companies about car insurance rules .
taxi , leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to comply ##ing with state insurance laws and a host of agencies .
one senior executive at his firm spends nearly 20 % of his time on insurance , he says .
other forms of red tape are more per ##vas ##ive .
the most one ##rous , many entrepreneurs say , is the record - keeping and filing required by tax authorities .
comply ##ing with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second .
here is the red tape that ir ##ks surveyed business owners the most :
an employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee manual ##s do n ' t reflect the most recent laws , he says .
comply ##ing with these is enough to make business owners look forward to their own pension days .

she held her fire with her first production at the trinity earlier this season .
hers is a hand that will test the met ##tle of her audiences .

home ##fed said most of the troubled assets are apartment complexes , shopping malls and other commercial real estate .

home ##fed said the slide in loan origin ##ations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the california market .
it said its real - estate operations earned a record $ 21 . 7 million , more than double year - earlier real estate profit of $ 9 million .

yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were little changed in the latest week .
on one - year cds of $ 50 , 000 and less , the average slid to 8 . 02 % from 8 . 06 % .
both issues are among the most popular with individual investors .
` ` it ' s unclear how much rates can fall and how soon . ' '
changes in cd yields in the week ended tuesday were in line with b ##lip ##s up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months .
interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year .
the average yield on both two - year cds and five - year cds was 7 . 98 % .
some ju ##mbo ##s posted fraction ##al changes in average yields this week , both up and down .
six - month and one ##year yields were unchanged , on average .
` ` it ' s very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market . ' '
the small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks .

at first ua ##l did n ' t open because of an order im ##balance .
in the process , 4 . 9 million shares traded , making ua ##l the second most active issue on the big board .
he manned the ua ##l post yesterday with christopher bates , 33 , an energetic long islander who ' s a dead ring ##er for actor nicolas cage .
added mr . jacobs ##on , ` ` there were some pretty bad losses in the stock . ' '
the news told them it would be a while longer before ua ##l resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of g ##yra ##tions .
mess ##rs . jacobs ##on and bates walked on the big board floor at about 8 : 45 a . m . yesterday and immediately spotted trouble .
already entered in the big board ' s computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for 65 , 000 ua ##l shares .
there were rumors of $ 148 - a - share trades .
in the 45 minutes before the 9 : 30 opening bell , the jacobs ##on specialists kept getting sell orders , heavier than they imagined .
when ua ##l finally opened a half hour late , some 400 , 000 shares traded at $ 150 .
there was ` ` selling pressure from everyone , ' ' said one trader .
on that earlier day , the stock ' s trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath .
mr . bates usually handles day - to - day ua ##l trading on his own .
the 4 . 9 million - share volume flowing through the jacobs ##on specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock .
the heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps .
about 11 , 000 shares sold at $ 170 on the bell , representing about eight to 10 late orders , the specialists estimate .
big board traders praised the jacobs ##on specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt .
leaving the exchange at about 5 p . m . , the jacobs ##on specialists made no predictions about how trading might go today .
said earl ellis , a jacobs ##on partner who got involved in the ua ##l action , ` ` it all starts all over again ' ' today .
he also said investment by businesses is falling off .
of 1 , 224 companies surveyed , 31 % expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery , while only 28 % plan to spend more .
but despite mounting recession fears , government data do n ' t yet show the economy grinding to a halt .
unemployment , for example , has continued to decline , and the september trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports .
as a result , prime minister margaret thatcher ' s government is n ' t currently expected to ease interest rates before next spring , if then .
officials fear that any loosen ##ing this year could re ##kind ##le inflation or further weaken the pound against other major cu ##rre ##ncies .
the latest government figures said retail prices in september were up 7 . 6 % from a year earlier .
many economists have started predicting a mild recession next year .
but he said the down ##turn probably wo n ' t become a ` ` major contraction ' ' similar to those of 1974 and 1982 .
compared with the major economies on the continent , the u . k . faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months .
but while september exports rose to # 8 . 43 billion , imports shot up to # 10 . 37 billion .
increasingly , economists say the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of british industry .
` ` when the country gets wealth ##ier , we tend to buy high - quality imports , ' ' mr . owen said .

at the laurel race track , the breeders are roman ##cing people like tim hu ##lings , a beer packaging plant worker .
` ` just imagine how exciting that would be if that ' s your horse , ' ' he says .
but experts caution that this is n ' t a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet .
` ` you have to go into it firmly believing that it ' s the kind of investment where you can lose everything . ' '

tel ##e - communications , the u . s . ' s largest cable company , said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment .
tel ##e - communications is hbo ' s largest customer , and the two have a number of other business relationships .
earlier this year , time even discussed bringing tel ##e - communications in as an investor in hbo , executives at both companies said .
the purchase of the showtime stake is ` ` a direct slap in our face , ' ' said one senior time executive .

in addition to owning hbo , with 22 million subscribers , time warner separately operates cable - tv system serving about 5 . 6 million cable - tv subscribers .
tel ##e - communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers , and via ##com has about one million .
in its suit against time , via ##com says the ownership of both cable systems and cable - programming networks gives the company too much market power .
ironically , tel ##e - communications and time have often worked closely in the cable business .
but since time ' s merger with warner communications inc . , relations between the two have become strained .
each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated .
meanwhile , some legal observers say the tel ##e - communications investment and other developments are weakening via ##com ' s anti ##trust suit against time .

the airline industry ' s fortunes , in dazzling shape for most of the year , have taken a sudden turn for the worse in the past few weeks .
and they say the outlook for 1990 is nearly as bad .
now , many airline companies might become a lot less attractive as takeover targets on wall street .
the down ##turn also raises questions about the carriers ' ambitious orders for new airplanes , which currently total $ 32 . 5 billion over the next three years .
for travelers , though , the industry ' s problems have had some positive effects .
in recent weeks , airlines have cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try to win back customers .
others have tried to spruce up frequent - fl ##ier programs .
previously , airlines were limiting the programs because they were becoming too expensive .

revenue rose only 3 . 3 % in the latest period , to $ 1 . 53 billion from $ 1 . 48 billion .
revenue rose 12 % to $ 4 . 75 billion from $ 4 . 22 billion .
the results surprised many analysts , because usa ##ir has almost no competition in its pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of piedmont airlines .
shortly after announcing its quarterly loss , usa ##ir ' s stock tumbled $ 3 a share .
it ended at $ 40 . 125 , down $ 2 . 375 , in new york stock exchange composite trading .
` ` nobody was expecting this size of a loss , ' ' said paul ka ##ros , an analyst with first boston corp .
one airline executive , who declined to be identified , called the loss ` ` amazing . ' '
in announcing the results , usa ##ir cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently .
but so far , the effort has failed , and traffic is still slow .
airlines also say their frequent - fl ##ier programs are squeezing profits because awards are being red ##eem ##ed at a heavier - than - normal rate .
fuel costs were up 10 % in the third quarter .
labor costs , which leveled off in the past few years because of lower pay scales for newer employees , are on the ups ##wing again at many carriers .
` ` we can not quan ##tify the total adverse effects of hugo , ' ' said edwin col ##od ##ny , chairman and president of usa ##ir group .
whatever the cause for the down ##turn , few people are predicting any sudden improvement .

the year ##long schedule of festivities will be kicked off officially with a combination live and animation half - time special at the super bowl in january .
all the tie - ins , though , have some marketing experts questioning whether the party may go too far .
` ` if you want to cut through the cl ##utter , you have to make your message as distinct , sharp and individual as possible .
sharing a character with other ad ##vert ##iser ##s is n ' t a way to do that . ' '
but united media says it ' s very sc ##rup ##ulous with the contracts it hands out .
` ` we ' re not interested in promoting every single product that comes along , ' ' mr . shore says .
metropolitan life ad executives could n ' t be reached about the use of the peanuts characters by others .
but mr . shore says that company ' s exclusive advertising rights extend only to the insurance and financial services category .
mr . berry said the timing was a coincidence and that his decision was unrelated to mr . roman ' s departure .

the pilots are working under an expired contract , and the mach ##ini ##sts contract ex ##pire ##s next month .

even some takeover - stock traders said they could n ' t quarrel with the board ' s logic .
but the board ' s decision prompted many to bail out of the stock yesterday .
` ` this deal is like a roach motel , ' ' he said .
` ` they check in , but they ca n ' t check out . ' '
but both the traders and the pilots remain interested in some transaction .
so too , according to many reports , is british airways plc , despite its public withdrawal from the buy - out .

copper futures sold off sharply yesterday , influenced by declines in the stock market and dollar , and a rally in bonds .
stop - loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a pre ##de ##ter ##mined price .
he said the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slow ##down in manufacturing .
when the market fell below that level on monday and then yesterday could n ' t climb above that level , traders started selling out their positions .
more stop - loss orders were touched off all the way down to below $ 1 . 14 , where modest buying was attracted .
ms . rap ##top ##oulos said the settling of strikes in canada and mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year .
she thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ 1 . 09 to $ 1 . 10 range .
she thinks a recovery in the stock market would help copper rebound as well .
ms . rap ##top ##oulos noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky .
` ` however , if you exclude defense - related orders then durable goods were down 3 . 9 % .
i believe that number reflects a slowing economy . ' '
she said copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next tuesday .
mr . th ##rel ##kel ##d said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months , with declining use being the result .
` ` but , ' ' he added , ` ` we have had that exact same perception six times in the last six years . ' '
he noted that currently the ratio of available copper to consumption is about 3 . 5 weeks .
he said the normal ratio is five to six weeks .

` ` it takes three months to turn copper concentrate into cat ##ho ##des , ' ' he said .
if there is n ' t a recession , he said , ` ` we will be out of copper by the end of march .
if there is a recession that will change the statistical situation . ' '
he thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $ 1 . 65 a pound , which was reached last year .

but he noted that spec ##ulator ##s apparently do n ' t believe there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa .
the last time cocoa traded at prices as low as currently was in 1974 .

next to ko ##hl ##berg k ##ra ##vis roberts ' s mega ##bill ##ion r ##j ##r na ##bis ##co deal , sci television is small fry .
but the troubles of sci tv are a classic tale of the leverage ##d buy - out excess ##es of the 1980s , especially the asset - stripping game .
sci tv ' s buy - out was an ace in the hole for mr . k ##ra ##vis and for investors in k ##kr partnerships .
some junk - holders are said to be considering legal action against k ##kr or moves to force sci tv into bankruptcy court .
sci tv ' s six stations once were part of store ##r communications .
- l ##rb - store ##r also took $ 125 million of junior sci tv bonds as partial payment for the tv assets . - rr ##b -
on store ##r as a whole , k ##kr rack ##ed up compound annual returns of 60 % in the three years it owned store ##r .
sci tv ' s grace period for paying its bills is due to ex ##pire nov . 16 .
it now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to rest ##ru ##cture debt .
no major player in the sci tv deal will talk publicly .
mr . gill ##ett is said to be proud of his operating record ; he has lifted some stations ' ratings and turned around a detroit station .
as for junk - holders , they ' re discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by k ##kr .
people who have seen sci tv ' s restructuring plan say it offers concessions by k ##kr and gill ##ett corp .
but some militant sci tv junk - holders say that ' s not enough .
they contend that sci tv ' s equity now is worthless .
one investment banker who is n ' t involved in the deal says sci tv needs at least $ 50 million of new equity to survive .
this could be the first major bankruptcy - law proceeding for k ##kr , he adds .
a big bankruptcy - court case might tar ##nish k ##kr ' s name , and provide new fuel for critics of lb ##os in washington and elsewhere .
but others say junk - holders have nothing to gain by putting sci tv into bankruptcy - law proceedings .
but with seaman , k ##kr was only trying to salvage its original investment , says bankruptcy investor james rubin of sas ##s lam ##le rubin in new york .
by contrast , k ##kr probably has already made all the money it can on sci tv .
and people who know mr . k ##ra ##vis say he is n ' t in a hurry to pour more money into sci tv .

` ` october 13th left us with a cut and exposed nerve , ' ' said jack solomon , technical analyst for bear ste ##arns .
everybody ' s finger is one inch closer to the button .
i have never had as many calls as i had this morning .
vol ##ati ##lity is here to stay . ' '
the dow jones industrial average plunged about 80 points in slightly more than one hour after the opening bell .
for many , it began to look like a replay of oct . 13 .
as stocks and stock - index futures fell , a trading limit was hit in the s & p 500 stock futures pit .
that caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the big board .
but at a critical moment , stock - index ar ##bit ##rage traders showed their power and control .
they scooped up hundreds of s & p futures when the market needed it most .
` ` it is very clear that those buy orders came from people who wanted their franchise protected , ' ' said one chicago - based futures trader .
` ` these guys wanted to do something to show how powerful they are . ' '
traders said goldman sachs , shear ##son lehman hutton and sal ##omo ##n brothers were the main force behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment .
officials at goldman sachs and sal ##omo ##n brothers were unavailable for comment .
as in the oct . 13 massacre , yesterday morning ' s drop was triggered by bad news for spec ##ulator ##s in ua ##l .
ua ##l finally opened for trading at 10 : 08 a . m . at 150 , down $ 28 .
floor traders said there was a huge crowd around the big board specialist ' s post where ua ##l trades .
` ` there was a see ##thing mass of people , ' ' said one floor trader .
` ` then there was a big liquidation of stock ' ' across the board , he added .
shortly after the ua ##l opening , program traders started selling stocks in the major market index and s & p 500 index .
the 20 - stock mm ##i mimic ##s the dow jones industrial average .
by 10 : 30 a . m . the dow was down 62 . 70 .
all 20 - stocks in the mm ##i except ex ##xon , general motors and sears were down $ 1 to $ 2 .
under the rules adopted by the chicago mercantile exchange , the futures contract can not drop below the limit , but buyers can purchase futures .
at this point , the dow industrial ##s were down 75 . 41 points and falling .
the trading halt in the s & p 500 futures ex ##ace ##rba ##ted selling and confusion , many traders maintain .
but as the fright began to spread through the s & p pit , the big broker ##age firms came in and bought futures aggressively .
` ` it was who ##oo ##sh ! ' ' said one futures trader .
in five minutes , the dow industrial ##s climbed almost 30 points .
the big futures buying triggered stock - index buy programs that eventually trimmed the dow ' s loss to 31 points by 11 a . m .
traders said the futures buying was finely calculated by program traders .
then they completed the other side of the trade by buying futures , which abruptly halted the stock market ' s decline as traders began to buy stocks .
from then on , the dow industrial ##s held at a loss of 40 to 50 points .
almost simultaneously , pain ##ew ##eb ##ber began a very visible buy program for dozens of stocks .
the combined buying rallied the dow into a small gain , before closing at a slight loss .
` ` this is fun , ' ' asserted susan del sign ##ore , head equity trader at travelers investment management co .
she said she used the market ' s wild swings to buy shares cheap ##ly on the sell - off .
on the comeback , ms . del sign ##ore un ##loaded shares she has been aiming to get rid of .
but traders who risk money handling big blocks of stock were shaken .
` ` this market is eating away my youth , ' ' said chung lew , head equity trader at klein ##wo ##rt benson north america inc .
but i think we are losing credibility because when the market does this , it does n ' t present itself as a rational investment .
but if you overlook all this , it is a beautiful market for investment still . ' '

after being whip ##sa ##wed by a volatile stock market , treasury bonds closed higher .
that happens when nervous stock investors dump e ##qui ##ties and buy treasury ##s , which are higher in quality and thus considered safe .
at one point , the dow jones industrial average fell about 80 points on news that ua ##l corp . decided to remain independent .
in response , treasury prices soared 1 1 \ / 8 points , or about $ 11 . 25 for each $ 1 , 000 face amount .

meanwhile , investors turned a cold shoulder to the treasury ' s sale of $ 10 billion of new two - year notes yesterday .
the new two - year notes were priced with an average yield of 7 . 74 % .
that was higher than the 7 . 71 % to 7 . 73 % average yield that traders had expected .
in when - issued trading , the notes were quoted at a price to yield 7 . 78 % .
the ratio , which reflects the number of bids the treasury receives for each bid accepted , is used to gauge investor demand .
individual and japanese participation in the auction was disappointing , according to dealers .
` ` interest by japanese investors was limited , ' ' said michael moran , chief economist at dai ##wa securities america inc .
a trader at a japanese firm estimated that the japanese purchased no more than 10 % of the two - year notes .
today investors will focus on the long - awaited auction of $ 4 . 5 billion of 30 - year bonds by resolution funding corp .
in when - issued trading , the ref ##corp bonds were quoted at a price to yield 8 . 17 % .
short - term rates were unchanged to slightly lower .
rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
thus , higher bidding narrows the investor ' s return while lower bidding widen ##s it .

actively traded municipal bonds ended 1 \ / 4 to 1 \ / 2 point higher in brisk trading , despite a flood of new supply .

also , municipal bonds lured buying because the stock market remains wo ##bbly , traders contend ##ed .
mainly , though , it was a favorable outlook for yesterday ' s new supply that propped up municipal ##s , some traders said .
among the new issues was massachusetts ' s $ 230 million of general obligation bonds .
the bonds were won by a goldman , sachs & co . group with a true interest cost of 7 . 17 % .
they were priced to yield from 6 . 00 % in 1990 to 7 . 20 % in 2009 .

genetic defect spotted in 3 - day - old embryo
researchers diagnosed a genetic defect in a three - day - old mouse embryo in an experiment directly applicable to humans .
pre ##nat ##al diagnosis of genetic defects as early as the sixth week of pregnancy is increasingly common today .
it ' s an inherited human disorder that ' s been duplicate ##d in mice .
in the experiment , mice with the defective gene were mated .
three days later , before the new embryo had become implant ##ed in the ut ##erus , it was washed out of the mother mouse .
the embryo had progressed only to a cl ##ump of eight identical cells .
one cell was teased out , and its dna extracted .
a genetic probe showed the hem ##og ##lo ##bin gene was missing , the researchers report in the medical journal lance ##t .
in the report , two molecular biologist ##s suggest such embryo diagnosis can be used by couples at high risk of passing a genetic defect to a child .
when the fe ##rti ##lized cells divide to eight cells , a single cell from each embryo can be tested for genetic defects .
a healthy embryo can be picked for implant ##ation and defective ones discarded .
or in other couples , the embryo could be temporarily taken out and tested three days after conception and returned if healthy , or discarded if not .
yeast adapted to make gene - sp ##lice ##d drugs
an oil company finds a side ##line in the microscopic world of yeast .
phillips found and improved a yeast , ` ` pic ##hia pastor ##is , ' ' which made protein from natural gas - derived alcohol .
it also could convert glucose from farm waste ##s into edible protein .
single - cell protein never pan ##ned out , and most companies abandoned such research .
but phillips persisted , calling in scientists from the sal ##k institute .
they ' ve now adapted the yeast to making genetically engineered drugs .
like the bacteria used by genetic engineers , the yeast can take in human genes and chu ##rn out human proteins for medical use .
but the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of animals than the bacterial genetic apparatus .
thus , the proteins from the yeast are molecular ##ly more like human proteins than those from bacteria .
the oil company claims its yeast system also is better than bacteria at high - volume production of genetically engineered drugs .

the government contract required meredith relocation corp . to purchase employees ' homes based on independent app ##rai ##sal ##s .
the department also said it seeks ` ` three times the government ' s damages , which are presently und ##eter ##mined , plus penalties . ' '
officials with meredith did n ' t have any immediate comment on the suit .
when such claims and litigation extend beyond the period , the syndicate ##s can extend their accounting deadline ##s .
lloyd ' s said there are currently 115 open account years involving 68 of the market ' s roughly 360 syndicate ##s .
the procedure causes ` ` great uncertainty ' ' because an investor ca n ' t be sure of his or her individual liability , lloyd ' s said .
as a result , the insurance market plans new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave years open .
lloyd ' s said it expects to en ##act new rules man ##dating the changes by year end .
under the new rules , the officials will have to secure additional information and reports from act ##uaries , including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably .
in addition , officials will have to get quotes for certain reins ##urance contracts and obtain approval ##s from other syndicate directors .

the drop in earnings had been anticipated by most wall street analysts , but the results were reported after the market closed .
computer associates closed at $ 13 . 625 , down 25 cents , in composite trading on the new york stock exchange .
anthony wang , president , attributed the drop to the disruption of the company ' s business resulting from the prolonged process of acquiring cu ##llin ##et .
in august , the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed , and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed .
residents of this city soon will be seeing ads urging them to visit ` ` cleveland ' s outdoor museum ' ' - - lake view cemetery .
despite such famous tenants as oil magnate john d . rockefeller , lake view cemetery has fallen on hard times .
so the inner - city burial ground is trying to res ##ur ##re ##ct itself with a television advertising campaign .
the ads celebrate the achievements of some of lake view ' s residents .
another focuses on charles brush , the first person to light a city electrically .
it shows a boy hurling rocks at a street lamp .
street lights , the ad points out , ` ` helped sharpe ##n the arm of many a bud ##ding baseball player . ' '
cemetery officials hope the ads , which will begin airing next month , will not only draw visitors but bo ##lster burials and endowment fund contributions .
lake view had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out - of - repair and crime - in ##fest ##ed cemetery .
the private , non - profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for - profit counterparts , which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots .
` ` we do n ' t want to be known as ambulance chase ##rs , ' ' says william garrison , lake view ' s president .
` ` we want people to think of lake view as an historical park and educational experience . . . .
a pleasant place to come and spend a few hours . ' '
not all of the cemetery ' s better - known tenants lend themselves to the promotional job at hand , however .
for example , president james a . garfield is en ##tom ##bed here , the victim of an assassination in 1881 .
mr . rockefeller , buried beneath a 180 - foot - tall granite obe ##lis ##k , did n ' t seem right for an ad either .
euro disneyland shares made a debut like snow white yesterday while most of the london stock market looked like it had eaten the evil queen ' s poisoned apple .
the overall london market , following wall street ' s early nosed ##ive , took a late beating .

most of the buying was institutional , he added .
u . s . investors will be permitted to buy the shares from ec investors 90 days later .
because of the interest connected with the issue , the london exchange took the unusual step of letting traders establish an officially sanctioned when - issued market .
a volatile , unofficial ` ` gray ' ' market in the shares has been operating in paris for about two weeks .
` ` there should be no great rush for investors to buy this .
he succeeds l . l . white jr . , 62 , who resigned but continues as a director .

the statement was part of a ford filing with the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
ford did n ' t say how much it might offer for jaguar , or when .
the british government currently forbid ##s any outside investor from holding more than 15 % of the company ' s shares without permission until dec . 31 ,
a successful vote would put pressure on the british government to lift the restriction .
` ` we have not made that decision ' ' to seek a jaguar special shareholders ' meeting , said marty ##n watkins , a ford spokesman in london .
last month , ford announced plans to acquire as much as 15 % of jaguar .
since then , jaguar officials have confirmed that they are discussing an alliance with gm and said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement within a month .
but the spec ##ter of ford eventually launching a full - fledged bid could un ##rave ##l the gm - jaguar talks .
he predicted ford officials will meet with jaguar executives in the next week to outline their proposed offer .
they will have to throw their hat in the ring . ' '
a gm spokesman yesterday reiterated the company ' s interest in acquiring a minority stake to help jaguar remain independent .
the prospect of such a takeover fight has sent jaguar shares soaring in recent weeks .
u . s . takeover - stock spec ##ulator ##s now own an estimated 25 % of jaguar shares .
both ford and gm badly need a luxury brand to combat new competition from the japanese in the european and u . s . markets .
and financially strapped jaguar has spent over a year looking for a rich uncle to provide cash and technological know - how .
the company has expressed a preference for gm over ford because gm has promised it would keep jaguar independent .
then , last friday , ford ' s talks about a possible alliance with sa ##ab - scan ##ia ab of sweden collapsed .
its op ##el line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models , but it lacks jaguar ' s cache ##t .
an increase in production at some major oil fields in the north sea , which had been knocked out by an explosion in july 1988 , also aided results .
the sale of a portion of refining and marketing operations to saudi arabia helped alleviate the decline in earnings from that business .
` ` the company has been completely rev ##amp ##ed , ' ' said frank kn ##uet ##tel , analyst for pr ##ude ##ntial - bach ##e securities inc .

sun said some of the growth reflects higher earnings in the oil sands operation of sun ##cor , a majority - owned canadian subsidiary .
chairman robert mcc ##lem ##ents jr . said the synthetic crude oil production from the facility rose even as the price for that oil increased .
overseas exploration and production results also improved because of additional output from the north sea magnus field , a portion of which was acquired by sun earlier this year .
results declined , however , in sun ' s refining and marketing and coal businesses .
president frank richardson attributed the decline to lower natural gas prices , which countered higher earnings from the crude oil sector of shell ' s exploration and production operation .

the trade deficit in the first eight months is already wider than the trade gap of $ 1 . 09 billion for all of 1988 .
analysts expect the trade gap for the year to sur ##pass $ 2 billion as demand for capital equipment and raw materials continues to push imports higher .

two japanese scientists said they discovered an antibody that , in laboratory test - tube experiments , kills aids - infected cells while preserving healthy cells .
if further experiments are successful , the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome .
the drug az ##t , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of aids , not to cure it .
but several analysts and japanese scientists familiar with the study , which was announced at a conference in nagoya yesterday , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results .
and the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans .
in some of the experiments , it killed almost all the infected cells , the researchers said .
meanwhile , fewer than 10 % of the healthy cells were killed .
the two said they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals .
they said they hoped to conduct tests on human patients in the u . s . by late next year .
japan does n ' t have enough aids patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they said .
the announcement got wide exposure in the japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday .
he said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so would n ' t be killed even after exposure to the antibody .
dr . kobayashi responded that he thought the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells .
but he and dr . yo ##ne ##hara said there were still several uncertain ##ties , particularly regarding possible side effects .
` ` we do n ' t know the effect of our antibody on the human body . ' '
he said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in january in new orleans , the japanese will present at least three more drugs for human testing .
az ##t is the world ' s only prescription medicine approved for treating the disease .
well ##com ##e plc , a major british pharmaceutical maker , sells the drug under the name retro ##vir .

` ` fund managers do n ' t like to have rights issues that do n ' t have an obvious reason .
the obvious reason was - l ##rb - for british air - rr ##b - to buy a stake in united airlines . ' '

a definitive agreement had been expected by the end of july .
the failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on british air shares .

one of mr . roberts ' s observations is that the bank ' s own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries .

magazine publishers are facing spiral ##ing costs and a g ##lu ##t of new titles .
but even a raft of recent failures is n ' t stopping them from launching new publications .
at the american magazine conference here , publishers are plenty worried about the industry ' s wo ##es .

in the process , litigation sciences is quietly but in ##ex ##ora ##bly res ##ha ##ping the world of law .
twenty - one of its workers are ph . d . s .
with jury verdict ##s getting bigger all the time , companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice .
recently , litigation sciences helped penn ##zo ##il co . win a $ 10 . 5 billion jury verdict against tex ##aco inc .
it advised the national football league in its largely successful defense of anti ##trust charges by the united states football league .
largely as a result , litigation sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years .
meanwhile , competitors are being spawned almost daily ; some 300 new businesses - - many just one - person shops - - have sprung up .
mr . vin ##son estimates the industry ' s total revenues approach $ 200 million .
in any high - stakes case , you can be sure that one side or the other - - or even both - - is using litigation consultants .
despite their u ##bi ##qui ##ty , the consultants are n ' t entirely welcome .
after hours of conflict and debate , that jury focuses on the facts with near - perfect object ##ivity .
litigation consulting is , as new york trial attorney donald zoe ##ller puts it , ` ` highly mani ##pu ##lative . ' '
he adds , ` ` the notion they try to sell is that ju ##ries do n ' t make decisions rational ##ly .
but the effort is also being made to try and cause ju ##ror ##s not to decide things rational ##ly .
but mr . zoe ##ller also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective .
others complain that the consultants ' growing influence ex ##ace ##rba ##tes the advantage of lit ##igan ##ts wealthy enough to afford such price ##y services .
sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases .
the harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which daniel be ##rrigan and others were charged with plotting anti - war - related violence , was a landmark .
in that case , a group of left - leaning sociologist ##s interviewed 252 registered voters around harrisburg .
the defense also learned that college - educated people were un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##istic ##ally conservative about the vietnam war .
a more blue - collar panel became a second aim .
the fledgling science went corporate in 1977 when international business machines corp . hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex anti ##trust case .
the problem for ibm trial lawyers thomas barr and david bo ##ies was how to make such a highly technical case understand ##able .
as the trial progressed , they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them .
he then brief ##ed mess ##rs . bo ##ies and barr , who had the chance to tilt their next day ' s presentation accordingly .
thus , the ` ` shadow ' ' jury was born .
mr . vin ##son , the professor , got the law bug and formed litigation sciences .
- l ##rb - ibm won the case . - rr ##b -
a shadow jury is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way . ' '
energy transportation retained litigation sciences , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars , to poll , pre - try , profile and shadow .
the ju ##ror ##s , who did n ' t know which side had retained them , decided for energy transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages .
the real jury returned days later with a $ 345 million victory for energy transportation .
` ` it ' s just like weather forecast ##ing , ' ' says energy transportation trial attorney harry reason ##er of vin ##son & elk ##ins .
` ` it ' s often wrong , but it ' s better than consulting an indian rain dancer . ' '
forecast ##ing is only one part of litigation sciences ' work .
changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters .
and to the un ##ini ##tia ##ted , some of the firm ' s approaches may seem chilling ##ly mani ##pu ##lative .
theoretically , ju ##ror ##s are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case logical ##ly and objective ##ly .
pre - trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of ju ##ror .
someone with a master ' s degree in classical arts who works in a del ##i would be ideal , litigation sciences advises .
for personal - injury cases , litigation sciences seeks defense ju ##ror ##s who believe that most people , including victims , get what they deserve .
such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , blacks and women .
litigation sciences does n ' t make moral distinctions .
if a client needs prejudice ##d ju ##ror ##s , the firm will help find them .
as mr . vin ##son explains it , ` ` we do n ' t control the facts .
but any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ .
in our system of advocacy , the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can . ' '
more important are what l ##si calls ` ` psychological anchors ' ' - - a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level .
by repeatedly drawing the jury ' s attention to the arm , the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman ' s injuries .
in a classic defense of a personal - injury case , the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame .
slick graphics , pre - tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in litigation sciences ' operation .
studies show , the consultants say , that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually .
` ` the average american watches seven hours of tv a day .
they are very visually sophisticated , ' ' explains l ##si graphics specialist robert se ##lt ##zer .
lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this .
supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics .
` ` what you have here is intuition made manifest . ' '
many lawyers maintain that all ' s fair in the adversary system as long as no one tam ##pers with the evidence .
others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment - - and used that to advantage .
litigation consulting is n ' t a guarantee of a favorable outcome .
litigation sciences con ##cede ##s that in one in 20 cases it was flat ##out wrong in its predictions .
some lit ##iga ##tors sc ##off at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick .
he says he used consultants in the case but ` ` found them to be virtually useless . ' '
but most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken .
and the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while undergoing such a skill ##ful massage .
for more than a decade , mr . et ##zio ##ni , the sociologist , has been a leading critic of the mass ##eurs .
` ` there ' s no reason to believe that ju ##ries rule inappropriate ##ly , ' ' he says .
` ` but the last thing you want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make them think better .
what you then do is you make them think inappropriate ##ly . ' '
in most civil cases , judges allow each side three such challenges .
for complex cases , judges sometimes allow many more .
mr . et ##zio ##ni also suggests forbid ##ding anyone from gathering background information about the ju ##ror ##s .
furthermore , he says , psychologists should not be allowed to analyze ju ##ror ##s ' personalities .
even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact .
the other involves the sale of about 35 of the company ' s high - end works ##tation ##s to the national institutes of health .
the models , which cost about $ 75 , 000 each , will be used in research .
the awards are evidence that silicon graphics ' approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop computers , analysts said .
` ` the company ' s on a roll , ' ' said robert her ##wick , an analyst at ham ##bre ##cht & qui ##st .
` ` no other - lc ##b - computer - rc ##b - vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price . ' '
in addition , the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices .
silicon graphics also plans to un ##ve ##il even less expensive machines in the near future .
silicon graphics ' strategy seems to be paying off .
revenue for its first quarter ended sept . 30 was $ 86 . 4 million , a 95 % increase over the year - ago period .

remember those bulky , thick - walled refrigerator ##s of 30 years ago ?
they , or at least something less efficient than today ' s thin - walled units , may soon be making a comeback .
that something , whatever it is , could add as much as $ 100 to the $ 600 or so consumers now pay for lower - priced refrigerator ##s .
world - wide production would be cut in half by 1998 .
the u . s . senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0 .
that ' s a lot of ban ##ishment , as it turns out .
gases containing cf ##cs are pumped into poly ##ure ##than ##e to make the foam used in pillows , up ##hol ##ster ##y and insulation .
hence , as they see it , if something is n ' t done earth ##lings will become ever more subject to sun ##burn and skin cancer .
` ` in the kind of literature i read i come across counter ##va ##iling opinions quite frequently .
but the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon , before all the evidence is in .
we ca n ' t afford to wait . ' '
it ' s easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the u . s . .
but ozone creation is a very large - scale natural process and the importance of human - generated cf ##cs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture .
the ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure .
what scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over antarctica that expands or contracts from year to year .
but it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerator ##s in antarctica .
moreover , surely someone has noticed that household refrigerator ##s are closed systems , running for many years without either the cf ##c gas or the insulation ever escaping .
another argument of the environmental ##ists is that if substitutes are available , why not use them ?
mr . tea ##gan cites a list of substitutes but none , so far , match the non ##fl ##am ##mable , non ##to ##xi ##c cf ##cs .
but ##ane and prop ##ane can be used as cool ##ants , for example , but are fl ##am ##mable .
as it happens , arthur d . little is not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone de ##ple ##tion and global warming theories .
it is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without cf ##cs .
there is , after all , big money in environmental ##ism .
fr ##eon , introduced in 1930 , revolution ##ized america by making ref ##ri ##ger ##ation and air conditioning practical after all .
du pont , as it happens , has a potential substitute for cf ##cs .
imperial chemical industries of the u . k . also has one , and is building a plant in louisiana to produce it .
japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets , of course .
there are still others who do n ' t mind seeing new crises arise .
environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mail ##ings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it .
they needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts .
in other words , environmental ##ism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few .
there is an element of make - work involved .
consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air - conditioned car .
if they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster , the price would be cheap .
but if there is no impending threat , it can get to be very expensive .

small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals next year .
despite victories this year , small business fears losing parental - leave war .
similar proposals were defeated in at least 15 other states .
but small business , which generally det ##est ##s government - mandated benefits , has taken note of the growing number of close votes .
` ` it ' s just a matter of time before the tide turns , ' ' says one midwest ##ern lobby ##ist .
consequently , small business is taking more ` ` pro - active ' ' steps to counter mandated leaves .
in pennsylvania , small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative ; they favor a commission that would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt .
they also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave .
in 1990 , the issue is expected to be especially close in alaska , california , michigan , new york , pennsylvania and illinois .
in los angeles , more small businesses ponder adopting a child - care policy .
the prefer ##ential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts under $ 25 , 000 and consulting and temporary services - - which often go to the smaller concerns .
firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child - care arrangements they provide .

city officials feared widespread grid ##lock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last tuesday ' s earthquake .
it will take several weeks to repair the bridge , and several months to repair some of the 101 connections .
for the first time in memory , it was standing - room only in bart ' s sleek , modern rail ##cars .
moreover , the two main bridges still connecting san francisco with the east bay did n ' t charge toll ##s , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping .
bus schedules were sometimes in di ##sar ##ray , strand ##ing commuter ##s such as marilyn sullivan .
yesterday , she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours , trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district .
` ` it ' s worse than i thought , ' ' she said .
` ` i do n ' t know where all the buses are . ' '
but while traffic was heavy early in the com ##mute over the golden gate , by 8 a . m . it already had thin ##ned out .
i think a lot of people got scared and stayed home . ' '
at the san mateo bridge , which connects the san francisco peninsula with the east bay , police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved .
` ` everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperate ##d , ' ' said stan perez , a sergeant with the california highway patrol .
there were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role .
the golden gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday , but over four hours rather than the usual two - hour crush .
the flex ##time may cut by almost a third the number of pg & e employees working conventional 9 - 5 hours , a spokesman says .
some individuals went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated grid ##lock .
one senior vice president at be ##cht ##el said he got up at 3 a . m . to drive into san francisco from the east bay .
but transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last .
and some commuter ##s , relieved by the absence of grid ##lock , were planning to return to their old ways .
playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuver ##ed deep thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position .
then he unleashed his own , un ##sto ##ppa ##ble , attack .
and when mr . ka ##spar ##ov strode into the playing hall , he called the outcome .
mr . ka ##spar ##ov was under ##w ##helm ##ed .
` ` the computer ' s mind is too straight , too primitive , ' ' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top , he said .
the champion apparently was not worried at all about d . t . ' s strong points .
in fact , d . t . never left home , carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh , but communicated with its human handler ##s by telephone link .
but the handler ##s mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed k ##ry ##pton ##ite .
this became apparent as game one , a sicilian defense by mr . ka ##spar ##ov , proceeded .
no human can examine millions of moves , but mr . ka ##spar ##ov , using his in ##ef ##fa ##bly powerful brain , consistently found very good ones .
but the computer did n ' t play mr . short ' s ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly .
by move 21 , d . t . had fallen into a deep position ##al trap .
it allowed mr . ka ##spar ##ov to exchange his dark - squared bishop for one of d . t . ' s knights .
indeed , it looked more like a pawn , a ` ` tall pawn , ' ' as spectators s ##ni ##del ##y put it .
consistently , d . t . was over - optimistic about its chances , which it continually sized up , in numerical form .
when most spectators thought its position hopeless , the computer thought it was only , in effect , one - half of a pawn down .
such evaluation ##s met with der ##ision , and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have - - prompting more der ##ision .
while d . t . shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , mr . ka ##spar ##ov maneuver ##ed the knight to a dominant outpost .
he also launched a kings ##ide storm , sac ##ri ##fi ##cing a pawn to den ##ude d . t . ' s king .
no amount of we ##as ##ling could have saved this game for d . t .
` ` in a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , ' ' mr . ka ##spar ##ov said later .
after only 11 moves for each side , the computer ' s position was shaky .
greed ##ily , it grabbed a pawn , at the cost of facing a brutal attack .
and when a defensive move was called for , d . t . passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats .
mr . ka ##spar ##ov remarked later that ` ` even a weak club player ' ' would have avoided the queen move .
now , after only a dozen moves , spectators were looking for a mating combination .
on a demonstration board , em ##ce ##e shelby lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no spectator ref ##uted this line of play .
mr . ka ##spar ##ov ' s continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly .
in a hopeless position , the computer resigned rather than make its 37th move .
and mr . ka ##spar ##ov , to cheers and applause , marched back into the analysis room .
` ` in both games i got exactly what i wanted , ' ' he said .
what he had demonstrated , he added , is that there ' s more to chess than sheer calculation .

reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake - - especially if you do n ' t understand what you ' re investing in .
just ask richard blu ##men ##feld , a new jersey dentist who considers himself ` ` a reasonably sophisticated investor . ' '
` ` it was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly , ' ' dr . blu ##men ##feld recalls .
yields on five - year cds at major banks were averaging about 7 . 45 % , and 10 - year treasury notes were paying less than 8 % .
the problem is that the cd he bought for a retirement plan was n ' t a plain vanilla cd .
instead , his merrill broker put him in a zero - coup ##on cd , which is sold at a deep discount to its face value .
the difference between the price and the face value pay ##able at maturity is the investor ' s return .
more important , the cd was purchased on the secondary , or res ##ale , market .
` ` this is one thing i was never aware of , ' ' he says .
he assumed that principal and interest were ` ` fully ins ##ured up to $ 100 , 000 , ' ' he adds .
dr . blu ##men ##feld is n ' t unique .
dr . blu ##men ##feld con ##cede ##s he did n ' t fully understand what he was buying .
those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a ` ` fact sheet ' ' sent to all cd investors with their confirmation of sale .
computation ##s involving zero - coup ##on cds are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . ' '
` ` i assumed i was buying a cd as a cd , ' ' he says .
` ` there ' s a question whether broker ##s at the time were fully aware ' ' of the risks .
` ` we were n ' t sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . ' '
merrill lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose cds it sells , which it did n ' t provide in 1986 .
merrill lynch estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero - coup ##on cds .
still , there are several billion dollars of zero - coup ##on cds with various mat ##urities outstanding .
most zero - coup ##on cds are in mat ##urities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity .
dr . blu ##men ##feld says he ' s satisfied that his problem has been resolved .
and he says he ' s learned a lesson : ` ` you always have to watch out for yourself .

the international ##ization of the industry has been haste ##ned by foreign companies ' acquisitions of many u . s . producers .

but sales for u . s . franchise ##es were flat at best on a per - store basis despite weak 1988 figures .
since mcdonald ' s menu prices rose this year , the actual decline may have been more .
mcdonald ' s closed at $ 31 . 375 , up $ 1 , in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday .
one analyst noted that the company often has better store locations than do its franchise ##es , thus aiding promotional efforts .
there are more than three times as many franchise ##d domestic outlets as there are company stores .
overseas , both franchise ##es and the company performed substantially better than a year ago .
mcdonald ' s said that system ##wide sales would have been $ 115 million greater had 1988 exchange rates remained in effect .

that ship , which would carry about 2 , 050 passengers , would expand the capacity of carnival ' s existing 14 - ship fleet by 24 % .
the second ship , which is half - completed , is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 , and the third in fall 1991 .
` ` the others will probably be delivered as well , but carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them . ' '
she said the company could pay as much as 25 % more for the ships .
if the ship fails to arrive , those per - share earnings estimates could be trimmed 15 cents or more .
analysts were n ' t willing to spec ##ulate on how much money carnival might lose through deposits .
normally , a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction .
carnival , for example , has already paid about $ 160 million of the total cost for fantasy .

eaton corp . had a 26 % drop in third - quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts , its largest and most profitable single business .
sales rose 2 . 8 % to $ 86 ##4 . 1 million , from $ 840 . 4 million .
he said eaton ' s quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated .
eaton said sales of truck axle ##s , transmissions and other parts fell 7 . 2 % to $ 295 million .
sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose .
mr . hard ##is said truck - fleet operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy behave ##s .
the company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial - switch market in north america and in the european app ##lian ##ce - controls market .
nine - month sales were $ 2 . 79 billion , up 8 . 2 % from $ 2 . 58 billion a year earlier .
in new york stock exchange composite trading , eaton closed at $ 57 . 50 a share , down $ 2 . 50 .
initial steps were taken at poland ' s first international environmental conference , which i attended last month .
even more remarkably , it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution , notwithstanding poland ' s lack of functioning markets .
why did east bloc participants unanimously end ##ors ##e market - based pollution approaches ?
the answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation .
like other east bloc countries , poland possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their ob ##ser ##vance .
norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soo ##t emissions .
poland produces about 20 times more soo ##t and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does western europe .
its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than west germany ' s , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average .
since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most poll ##uta ##nts have outs ##trip ##ped the growth of g ##np .
but their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state , making it fully accountable for pollution control .
indeed , skepticism was amp ##ly captured by a joke told by poles at the conference : ` ` the world must be coming to an end .
and the poles are engaged in commerce . ' '
market - based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries .
as con ##fer ##ees noted , scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimize ##d through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms .
that means simple , clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction , def ##er ##ring more complex issues such as risk .
it also means use of quantity - based pollution limits such as transfer ##able permits , rather than price - based limits such as e ##ff ##lu ##ent fees .
that ' s because quota - trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals .
even least - cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars .
new types of financing must make funds available without draining poland ' s hard - currency reserves .
east bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets .
while polish data have been freely available since 1980 , it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information .
for once information flows , public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to rei ##mp ##ose .
one participant prematurely declared that america has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection , while poland represents the opposite .
but the continuing pressures for free - market economics suggest the conference ' s vision was not all fantasy .
the drop in those and other technology stocks contributed to an 0 . 7 % slide by the nas ##da ##q composite index .
it finished at 46 ##7 . 22 , down 3 . 45 .
the nervous ##ness about the technology stock outlook also hurt the dow jones industrial average , which slipped about 1 % .
the nas ##da ##q financial index of giant insurance and banking issues lost 2 . 38 to 45 ##8 . 32 .
some traders said the sell - off of technology stocks on low volume reflected a lack of conviction by investors .
but charlie howl ##ey , vice president in charge of ot ##c trading at sound ##view financial in stamford , con ##n . , said the selling was orderly .
` ` it ' s a quiet retreat , ' ' said mr . howl ##ey .
` ` it ' s nothing dramatic , just a routine sell - off . ' '
some of it was due to lower - than - expected earnings from leading companies , he said .
but some of it also represented profit - taking by investors who have made big gains in some issues .
yesterday ' s volume of 117 . 2 million shares was far below last week ' s si ##zzling average of nearly 177 million .
for october so far , daily volume is averaging 150 . 3 million , putting it on track to be the year ' s busiest month .
apple computer , which reported lack ##lus ##ter earnings friday , lost 1 1 \ / 4 to 46 3 \ / 4 on 1 . 1 million shares .
investors apparently did n ' t like the news from rainbow technologies either .
it said net income was 17 cents a share in the third quarter , compared with 16 cents a share a year earlier .
rainbow ' s stock dropped 2 to 14 1 \ / 4 .
the increase of $ 1 . 25 a share is being made to settle shareholder litigation relating to si ##b ##v - ms ' s tender offer .
si ##b ##v - ms holdings is a new company jointly owned by an affiliate of jefferson sm ##ur ##fi ##t and a morgan stanley limited partnership .
the jefferson sm ##ur ##fi ##t affiliate , sm ##ur ##fi ##t international b . v . , holds about 78 % of the shares outstanding .
these shares will be bought by si ##b ##v - ms holdings at $ 41 . 75 each after the acquisition of the minority shares .
another takeover target , lin broadcasting , eased 1 \ / 2 to 110 1 \ / 8 on 313 , 800 shares .
lin ' s suit ##or , mcc ##aw cellular communications , dropped 1 to 40 on almost 350 , 000 shares .
some analysts say investors will begin paying more attention to earnings , partly in response to the latest round of disappointment ##s .
they say investors will favor companies that historically have posted annual earnings growth of 15 % to 20 % .
that would be good news for the ot ##c market , some analysts say , because many small growth stocks are traded there .
michael r . wei ##sberg , partner in charge of research at robertson stephens & co . in san francisco , said some investors have already made the switch .
the robertson stephens index of 340 emerging growth stocks is up 23 . 1 % for the year through friday .
the rise matches that of the dow jones industrial ##s this year .
` ` it ' s been a spectacular year for the emerging growth stock investor , ' ' mr . wei ##sberg said .
he puts the ot ##c market ' s nell ##cor , office club and bi ##z ##mart on the list .
bi ##z ##mart , another retail ##ing stock , was off 3 \ / 8 to 8 1 \ / 4 on nearly 80 , 000 shares .
other favorites of growth - stock analysts and money managers also had a mixed session .

novel ##l , a computer networking concern , fell 1 1 \ / 2 to 30 on 152 , 000 shares .
elsewhere , valley national continued its slide , dropping 2 1 \ / 8 to 15 on 1 . 7 million shares .
the arizona banking concern is facing difficulties related to weakness in the real estate market in the state .
why ca n ' t we teach our children to read , write and reckon ?
it ' s not that we do n ' t know how to , because we do .
it ' s that we do n ' t want to .
but what do we mean , specifically , by ` ` creativity ' ' ?
the result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual inc ##omp ##ete ##nce is matched only by their good opinion of themselves .
it is not surprising that parents find this romantic extra ##va ##gan ##ce so attractive .
fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands .
their commitment to ` ` creativity ' ' can not survive adolescent ill ##iter ##acy .
the education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way .

but it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment .
i know many school ##teacher ##s and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to con ##sc ##ient ##ious teaching .
they may not be among the ` ` best and brightest ' ' of their generation - - there are very few such people , by definition .
but they need not be to do their jobs well .
yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days .
but our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and con ##sc ##ient ##ious .
in this sense , a teacher can be compared to one ' s family doctor .
if he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place .
if he is competent and con ##sc ##ient ##ious , he serves us well .
our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis .
whether they are or are not under ##pa ##id is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem .
it is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .
it is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n ' t mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes .
it is also the kind of libel politicians find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency .
but there is not one sh ##red of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differential ##s result in educational differential ##s .
if there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
if we wish to be serious about american education , we know exactly what to do - - and , just as important , what not to do .
conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand .
we really do know all we need to know , if only we could ass ##imi ##late this knowledge into our thinking .
in this respect , it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute , rather than el ##o ##quent ##ly ` ` concerned . ' '
they are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pa ##p , since this is the least controversial option that is open to them .
a comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need .
what gov . clinton is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre - kindergarten years .
whether desirable or not , this is a child - care program , not an educational program .
we know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away .
parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children .
parents should be involved with their children ' s education at home , not in school .
if parents are dissatisfied with a school , they should have the option of switching to another .
- - ` ` community involvement ' ' is an even worse idea .
here , the experience of new york city is decisive .
- - in most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better .
the reason is simple : education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
the new money flows into the already top - heavy administrative structure , which bus ##ies itself pi ##ling more and more paper work on the teachers .
- - students should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows .
no student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 r ' s at the level that prevailed 20 years ago .
the notion that tracking is somehow ` ` und ##em ##oc ##ratic ' ' is absurd .
the purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential .
no one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential .
- - it is generally desirable to use older textbooks - - many of them , ala ##s , out of print - - rather than newer ones .
the latter are mod ##ish , trend ##y , often down ##right silly , and at best ins ##ub ##stan ##tial .
they are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience .
with that authority , of course , goes an una ##mb ##ig ##uous accountability .
schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance .

mr . lu ##rie is currently co - chief executive .
arnold levine , acting co - chief executive , will continue as senior vice president and a board member .
eagle also said it received a commitment for as much as $ 8 million in financing from norfolk capital group inc .
a committee representing the un ##se ##cured creditors agreed to accept 24 cents on the dollar , eagle said .
the plan would extend the period under which eagle has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan .

the tough ##er new regulations under the savings - and - loan bail ##out law are accelerating the th ##rift industry ' s shrinking act .
industry assets as of aug . 31 were $ 1 . 31 trillion , the lowest since august 1988 .
as interest rates paid deposit ##ors were lowered , th ##rift withdrawal ##s exceeded deposits by $ 5 . 1 billion , not including interest credited to accounts .
the asset shrink ##age was particularly concentrated in several large california institutions .
` ` the downs ##izing of the th ##rift industry is well under way , ' ' said bert ely , an industry consultant in alexandria , va .
` ` this suggests the bail ##out law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon . ' '
james bart ##h , an economist with the office of th ##rift supervision , also attributed some of the out ##flow to seasonal factors .
` ` august is a month when people are paying school tuition , ' ' he said .
` ` that and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry . ' '
as of aug . 31 , th ##rift ##s held $ 185 billion in mortgage - backed securities .
deposits are n ' t expected to exceed withdrawal ##s in the fore ##see ##able future , as the industry continues to shrink .
` ` i think we are going to see deposit shrink ##age continue , unless we see big changes in rates , ' ' mr . ely said .
for the first eight months of 1989 , th ##rift ##s ' withdrawal ##s exceeded deposits by $ 44 . 5 billion .
for the prior year , deposits exceeded withdrawal ##s by $ 8 . 8 billion .
the estimates of real gross national product prepared by the bureau of economic analysis in the department of commerce significantly under ##sta ##te the rate of economic growth .
in the early 1980s , i predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade .
there has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since 1981 .
but i had expected more , which is one reason i began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates .
- l ##rb - it is , however , possible , that further study will reveal increasing bias . - rr ##b -
the under ##sta ##tem ##ent of growth is due largely to the conservative ex ##ped ##ient ##s adopted to deal with def ##iciencies in basic economic data .
this means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor .
the federal productivity est ##ima ##tors use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well .
the second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate def ##lat ##ors to adjust for price changes .
finally , the official estimates under ##sta ##te growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services .
in sum , the bias ##es en ##num ##erated above indicate a 0 . 7 percentage point under ##sta ##tem ##ent in growth of total real g ##np .
for the private domestic business economy , the bias was a bit over 0 . 5 percentage point .
in other words , the growth rates of both total g ##np and real private business product per labor hour have been under ##est ##imated by about 20 % .

operating profit from carbon products , such as graph ##ite electrode ##s , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million .
in the industrial - gases segment , operating profit climbed to $ 87 million from $ 58 million .

up to now , dr ##ex ##el has made a rapid - fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of puerto rico .
officials in some of these states say they do n ' t want to simply accept the settlements offered by dr ##ex ##el .
they question if dr ##ex ##el is getting easier treatment than the many small penny - stock firms whose broker ##age licenses are routinely revoked .
these stem from a two - year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on wall street .
but they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public .
still , ` ` i understand the reasons ' ' that other states are holding out , he said .
by the end of this week , dr ##ex ##el should have another three to four settlements , mr . cohen said .
that total would be important for dr ##ex ##el .
the investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry .
a pro ##vis ##o to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next tuesday .
new jersey , for example , was asked to accept $ 300 , 000 , but refused .
the state is n ' t ruling out rev ##oki ##ng dr ##ex ##el ' s broker ##age license .
the state can also bar dr ##ex ##el as an investment adviser .
connecticut already has issued a ` ` notice of intent ' ' to rev ##oke dr ##ex ##el ' s broker ##age license .
it is one of the states that have met with mr . cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters .
` ` this particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital - formation market , ' ' state banking commissioner howard brown said .
a banking department spokesman added : ` ` commissioner brown does n ' t feel that money alone is the issue here . ' '
neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n ' t discuss their reasons for not doing so .
but dr ##ex ##el has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials .
still , she said , dr ##ex ##el ' s trouble with some states is n ' t a bad thing .
` ` we need to have somebody worried so they do n ' t do this again . ' '
time warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining warner shares .
some analysts at least are buying that argument , and were n ' t alarmed by the losses .
` ` for example , warner made more than $ 100 million from filmed entertainment in three months .
in the year - ago third quarter , time on its own reported net income of $ 81 million , or $ 1 . 42 a share .
on the same basis , revenue rose to $ 2 . 7 billion from $ 2 . 2 billion .
for the third quarter , warner ' s $ 106 million loss compared with a year - ago loss of $ 113 million , or 90 cents a share .
revenue rose to $ 1 . 5 billion from $ 1 . 1 billion .
the 1988 figures were rest ##ated to include the results of lori ##mar tel ##ep ##ic ##tures corp . , which warner acquired in january .
time warner ' s operating earnings got a boost from warner ' s record box - office results .
` ` lethal weapon ii ' ' was also a big hit .
in addition , the 1988 results included a $ 20 million charge reflecting a reserve for relocation related expenses at american television & communications corp .
in magazines , higher advertising revenues at sports illustrated and fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines .

at lloyd ' s of london , under ##writer ##s still scratch out policies using fountain pens and b ##lot ##ting paper .
such trapping ##s suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present .
lloyd ' s , once a pillar of the world insurance market , is being shaken to its very foundation .
the exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow , less - profitable segments of the market by less hide ##bound competitors .
some 1 , 750 members quit the exchange last year , more than triple the number of resignation ##s in 1987 .
names are resigning at an even faster pace this year .
in 1985 , it was 2 . 1 % .
investors may re ##ap huge profits when premium ##s exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
lloyd ' s claims for the 1988 piper alpha oil - rig disaster in the north sea , for instance , may reach $ 1 billion .
the per ##il of unlimited liability lo ##oms large for a number of them now .
` ` the downs ##ide is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . ' '
if profits do n ' t improve , mr . w ##hit ##ten says he may quit the exchange .
meanwhile , competition from rivals une ##nc ##umber ##ed by history is int ##ens ##ifying .
lloyd ' s is being squeezed out of low - margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance .
- l ##rb - the official asked not to be named . - rr ##b -
lloyd ' s has endured decades of gen ##tee ##l decline .
at the peak of its power and influence a century ago , lloyd ' s dominated the insurance world with a 50 % stake .
it virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a un ##ri ##vale ##d intelligence network in ports around the globe .
today , lloyd ' s share of the world market , excluding life insurance , is about 2 % .
- l ##rb - its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included . - rr ##b -
even lloyd ' s specialty - - unusually risky ventures - - is being challenged .
only 10 years ago , for instance , lloyd ' s was the pre - eminent ins ##urer of thoroughbred horses .
but since 1981 , kirk horse insurance inc . of lexington , ky . has grabbed a 20 % stake of the market .
thus , he asserts , lloyd ' s ca n ' t react quickly to competition .
` ` lloyd ' s has lost control of the situation , ' ' he says .
` ` they are n ' t controlling their destiny like they used to . ' '
murray lawrence , lloyd ' s chairman , agrees the exchange faces big challenges .
` ` this is a watershed time , and we are trying to plot our way ahead , ' ' he says .
` ` we have been a great market for in ##venting risks which other people then take , copy and cut rates . ' '
by that , he means low - margin but low - risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance .
the exchange , he says , must find new products and new markets .
that wo n ' t be an easy task .
- l ##rb - some exchange wa ##gs call the building ` ` the oil rig . ' ' - rr ##b -
but along with such treasure ##d artifacts as lord nelson ' s spy ##glass , lloyd ' s also brought its out ##mo ##ded ways of doing business .
the lloyd ' s market actively under ##write ##s insurance just 4 1 \ / 2 hours a day , broker ##s say .
under ##writing does n ' t get under way until after morning tea at 10 a . m .
things wind down at about 4 : 30 p . m . , just in time for afternoon tea .
lloyd ' s vast trading hall houses a warren of well - polished desk ##s .
the hall ' s few computers are used mostly to send messages .
sandwich ##ed between desk ##s , under ##writer ##s sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies .
broker ##s clutching thick folder ##s stand in lines , waiting their turn to speak to the under ##writer ##s .
a broker may have to approach as many as 20 under ##writer ##s who ins ##ure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicate ##s .
it could take six months for a claim to be paid .
some maintain under ##writer ##s also have been in ##ept .
lloyd ' s officials decline to comment on the matter .
many at lloyd ' s expect the san francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further .
but it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the pay ##outs for such disasters .
lloyd ' s only recently reported its financial results for 1986 .
that year , it posted record pre ##ta ##x profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .
but mr . lawrence says reported profit will be down in 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be .
lloyd ' s says the departure ##s of names is n ' t likely to hurt its under ##writing capacity , currently about # 11 billion .
mr . lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names .
meanwhile , the exchange has been trying to lower costs .
- l ##rb - it recently cut its work force by 9 % , or 213 . - rr ##b -
but lloyd ' s is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology .
though lloyd ' s has talked for years about computer ##izing under ##writing transactions , the effort has n ' t gotten very far .
competition among under ##writer ##s and broker ##s makes them lo ##ath to central ##ize price and policy information .
both groups cl ##ing to traditional face - to - face dealings , even for routine policies .
lloyd ' s over ##bl ##own bureaucracy also ham ##pers efforts to update marketing strategies .
some under ##writer ##s have been pressing for years to tap the low - margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers .
but such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of under ##writer ##s , broker ##s and administrators before being implemented .
the proposal to sell directly to the public remains mir ##ed in bureau ##cratic quick ##san ##d .
lloyd ' s is moving forward on some fronts , though .
mr . lawrence says the exchange is up ##dating some procedures to make speed ##ier payments on claims .
by next year , all under ##writer ##s will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims .
japan ' s dai ##wa securities co . named mas ##ah ##iro dozen president .
mr . dozen succeeds sad ##aka ##ne doi , who will become vice chairman .
yo ##shi ##tok ##i chin ##o retains his title of chairman of dai ##wa , japan ' s second - largest securities firm .
in japanese firms , the president usually is in charge of day - to - day operations , while the chairman ' s role is more a ceremonial one .
the title of chief executive officer is n ' t used .
dai ##wa is one of the world ' s largest securities firms .
american institutional investors have never had a large appetite for japanese e ##qui ##ties .
` ` but not a single piece of paper was sold . ' '
by his own account , mr . dozen did n ' t do much better with u . s . bonds .
` ` japanese stock sales ##men selling american bonds ?
maybe it ' s crazy , ' ' he said .
mr . dozen even related the ind ##ign ##ity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the new jersey shore and caught nothing .
mr . dozen joined dai ##wa upon his graduation from kyoto university in 1959 .
like many young recruits in japanese securities firms , he began his career pe ##ddling stock to individual investors .
commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of japanese securities companies ' earnings .
and anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force ` ` would be fragile , ' ' said a dai ##wa executive .
if mr . dozen has a weakness , it may be his golf game .
` ` he dig ##s in the sand instead of hitting the ball , like a farmer , ' ' said mr . yo ##ney ##ama .
inc ##o ltd . posted a 35 % decline in third - quarter net income , a performance that was in line with analysts ' expectations .
analysts said some investors were disappointed that the cash - rich company had failed to announce a special divide ##nd .
inc ##o closed at $ 31 . 125 a share , down 62 . 5 cents , in new york stock exchange composite trading .
the quarterly divide ##nd is pay ##able dec . 1 to shares of record nov . 3 .
sales rose 8 . 2 % to $ 84 ##8 . 7 million from $ 78 ##4 . 5 million .
inc ##o said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next 12 months if nickel market conditions are favorable .
under a previous buy ##back program , inc ##o has purchased 1 . 7 million of its shares since april .
as a result , ua ##l ' s chairman , stephen m . wolf , pulled out of the buy - out effort to focus on running the company .
just last week it suffered another major set ##back when british airways plc , the largest equity investor in the labor - management bid , withdrew its support .
takeover stock traders , focusing on the company ' s intention to stay independent , took the announcement as bad news .
but the board said it was n ' t interested for now .
that proposal , valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share , would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands .
the buy - out group had no firm financing for the plan .
and , with no other offers on the table , the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it .
but it was clear that for the time being , the board wants the company to return to normal ##cy .
mr . wolf urged all employees to ` ` now turn their full attention ' ' to operating the airline .
he also vowed to ` ` make every effort to nur ##ture . . . a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee groups . ' '
but mr . wolf faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again .
for a brief time , the buy - out effort seemed to solve his problems with united ' s pilot union .
that contract was tied to the success of the buy - out .
it ' s uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement .
the buy - out effort also worsened already - strained relations between united ' s pilot and mach ##ini ##st unions .
the mach ##ini ##sts criticized the terms mr . wolf and management received in the buy - out .
they paid $ 15 million for a 1 % stake and received an additional 9 % of the company at no additional cost .
his credibility is also on the line in the investment community .
the board ' s actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $ 700 million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer .
it also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits .
ar ##bit ##rage ##rs said they were disappointed the company did n ' t announce some rec ##ap ##ital ##ization or other plan to maximize value .
however , he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential ua ##l data .
essentially , he ca n ' t make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ 300 a share .
tan ##dy ' s decision is a second set ##back for u . s . memories .
last month , apple computer inc . said that it would n ' t invest in the group .
apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development .
those chips were in dire shortage last year , hurting many u . s . computer companies that could n ' t get sufficient japanese - supplied chips .
` ` i would like to have had them , ' ' he said .
but ` ` they were n ' t on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it . ' '
u . s . memories needs a catalyst , he said , to inspire others to join .
but so far , most potential participants have n ' t decided .
american telephone & telegraph co . said it was waiting to see u . s . memories ' business plan .

what went wrong in panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry .
but there ' s no danger of exposing sources and methods in disc ##los ##ing the debate running up and down pennsylvania avenue .
and if congress is going to assume authority to micro ##mana ##ge foreign policy , it ' s going to have to take some of the responsibility too .
the president of the united states urged the panama ##nian armed forces to move against mr . nor ##ieg ##a .
when they did , his commanders did n ' t have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads .
the executive branch bears the first responsibility for tim ##idi ##ty .
but what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by congress ?
mr . nor ##ieg ##a did n ' t suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol .
maybe we need a cia version of the miranda warning : you have the right to conceal your coup intentions , because we may rat on you .
or maybe a surgeon general ' s warning : con ##fi ##ding in the united states may be fatal .
in other words , congress wo n ' t let the cia do much of anything anymore , and that ' s fine with the cia .
the pay ' s the same , and the duty ' s lighter .
and of course , doing anything that might be second - guessed by congress carries heavy penalties .
no doubt many people in the cia , the pentagon and the national security council have read it .
what kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who ' ve read all this and know what can happen if they fail ?
who wants to end up as the protagonist in a bill cohen morality play ?
the order against assassination ##s is another artifact of the same congressional mind - set , a product of the 1970s vietnam syndrome against any executive action .
the world being the nasty place it is , we want presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed .
in such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure the president takes the responsibility .
the executive order and the reported agreements with the intelligence committee are neither sensible nor moral .
as it now stands , the u . s . can bomb tripoli , but ca n ' t ` ` assassinate ' ' colonel ga ##dha ##fi .

declining issues on the new york stock exchange out ##pace ##d advance ##rs , 1 , 01 ##2 to 501 .
recession fears are spring ##ing up again among investors .
on the other hand , investors beat a clear path yesterday to blue - chip issues with proven earnings growth records .
in another sign of slow ##down fears , investors dumped technology shares .
many money managers are bracing for a decline in stocks of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets .

who ' d have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputation ##s like that would be school superintendent ##s ?
chicago ' s new school chief is the hard - nosed ted kim ##bro ##ugh .
at his old job in compton , cal ##if . , he took a bitter teachers ' strike and nearly came to blows with a school - board member .
at his first chicago press conference , he be ##rated the reporters .
the subject of the movie ` ` lean on me , ' ' mr . clark controlled his school with a bull ##horn and a baseball bat .
mr . fernandez does n ' t take control in new york until january , but already he ' s roi ##ling the waters .
he ' s attacked the concept of ` ` building tenure , ' ' one of the most disgrace ##ful institutions in american public schools .
it means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer inc ##omp ##ete ##nt principals .
once they are in the building , they stay .
one south bronx principal kept his job for 16 years , despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work .
he was finally given leave when he was arrested for allegedly buying crack .
naturally , the principals ' union loves building tenure , and tenure has with ##sto ##od previous challenge .
in his old job , as dade county chief , mr . fernandez forced out 92 teachers and res ##hu ##ffled 48 principals .
he cut the drop ##out rate by 5 . 5 % .
the situation will be especially delicate for mr . kim ##bro ##ugh .
he takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform .
chicago ##ans have just elected 540 neo ##phy ##te school boards , one for each school .
this of course led to disaster in new york city .
the rise of superintendent ##s such as joseph fernandez and ted kim ##bro ##ugh suggests plainly the process of di ##sin ##te ##gration in many school systems .
the schools ' central mission , educating children , became sub ##sume ##d by the competing interests of bureau ##crats , politicians and unions .
the classroom itself operated on the periphery of this awful system , discipline collapsed , and kids stopped learning .
mr . chips was a nice fellow , and maybe some day he ' ll return .
ing ##ers ##oll publications co . agreed to buy the new haven register in a transaction valued at $ 275 million from goods ##on newspaper group inc .
goods ##on has accused ing ##ers ##oll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the st . louis sun .
goods ##on will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the management contract .
goods ##on also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of ing ##ers ##oll to run the goods ##on papers .
both executives left the company after clashes with chairman ralph ing ##ers ##oll jr .
industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high , causing a strain on goods ##on ' s finances .
investment bankers familiar with the company said goods ##on is seeking a new bank credit line of $ 190 million and may have to sell additional newspapers .
the association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer mark goods ##on and ing ##ers ##oll founder ralph ing ##ers ##oll .
ing ##ers ##oll has 28 dail ##ies and 200 other non - daily papers in the u . s . and europe .
the company said its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year .
he will succeed harry l . freeman , 57 , who has said he will retire in december .
american express representatives apparently influenced the publication of un ##fa ##vor ##able articles about mr . sa ##fra .
the company later apologized and agreed to make $ 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him .
although mr . freeman is retiring , he will continue to work as a consultant for american express on a project basis .
ad industry executives were n ' t surprised by mr . roman ' s decision to leave og ##il ##vy .
the agency , under his direction , bitterly fought a takeover attempt by w ##pp group plc of london before su ##cc ##umb ##ing in may .
some executives also cite tension because of efforts by mr . so ##rrell , a financial man , to cut costs at the agency .
alexander brody , 56 , will take on the newly created position of president of the world - wide agency and chief executive of its international operations .
mr . roman appears custom - made for the american express job .
known as a traditional executive , he is very much in the conservative american express mold .
he also is close to american express ' s chairman and chief executive officer , james d . robinson iii .
the abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that mr . roman had been pushed out of og ##il ##vy ' s top spot by mr . so ##rrell .
the implication that i was pushed aside would n ' t be accurate , ' ' mr . roman said .
mr . so ##rrell , traveling in the far east , could n ' t be reached .
mr . roman said american express ' s mr . robinson first approached him about the job in late september .
according to industry executives , peter sutherland , a former european community commissioner from ireland , was also a serious contender for the american express job .
although it ultimately was n ' t offered to him , he will be on retain ##er to american express as an adviser on international matters .
it was my decision , not anyone else ' s . ' '
mr . roman also brushed aside reports about in ##fighting between him and mr . phillips , his successor at og ##il ##vy .
mr . roman comes across as a low - key executive ; mr . phillips has a flash ##ier personality .
industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently , the w ##pp takeover brought them closer together .
would i have done all those things successively if i did n ' t think he was the right guy ? ' ' mr . roman asked .
he labeled reports of friction ` ` ridiculous , ' ' and said that he spent part of the weekend on mr . phillips ' s boat in connecticut .
` ` i consider this a second career , ' ' he said .
he also will sit on the company ' s corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives .
mr . roman ' s departure is n ' t expected to have any enormous rep ##er ##cus ##sions at og ##il ##vy .
american express , kraft general foods , and matt ##el executives said the move wo n ' t affect their relationships with the ad agency .
but some clients and analysts expressed concern that mr . phillips is n ' t as well - known to many clients .
` ` i do n ' t know - lc ##b - mr . phillips - rc ##b - all that well .
i have n ' t seen or talked to him in several years . ' '
and some analysts questioned whether mr . phillips would have the skills og ##il ##vy needs to turn the agency around .
` ` i think - lc ##b - mr . phillips - rc ##b - is going to need some help .
og ##il ##vy & math ##er ' s top creative executive , norman berry , left the agency earlier this year .
` ` norm berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , ' ' said ms . hill .
but other analysts said that having mr . phillips succeed mr . roman would make for a smooth transition .
` ` it ' s probably a reasonable transition .
hopefully , he ' ll be the answer to the problems they ' ve had in new york . ' '
computer sciences would n ' t disclose the proposed purchase price for cleveland consulting , which counsel ##s companies on logistics and supply .

in an interview , mr . hogan said the subsidiary ' s primary mission will be to make movies for tnt and to distribute them internationally .

the cost of buying the additional 48 % stake would be 10 . 95 billion francs - l ##rb - $ 1 . 74 billion - rr ##b - .
the move would greatly boost par ##iba ##s ' s stake in the insurance , transport and food businesses , where navigation mix ##te is strong .
it also would make par ##iba ##s a major french ally of west germany ' s all ##ian ##z ag insurance group .
all ##ian ##z holds a 50 % stake in navigation mix ##te ' s insurance interests , acquired three weeks ago .
those include r ##hin et mo ##selle vie and via assurance ##s .
long considered a potential takeover target , navigation mix ##te had hoped all ##ian ##z would help protect it from raiders .
par ##iba ##s is all ##ian ##z ' s main french bank , and the munich - based group said it intends to stay neutral .
navigation mix ##te said it would n ' t have any comment until its board meets wednesday .
but navigation mix ##te is loosely held and hard to defend .
` ` the defensive options are limited , ' ' says philippe bray ##e , a partner in portfolio management concern france finance qu ##at ##re .
` ` who would bid against par ##iba ##s ? ' '
if the par ##iba ##s bid succeeds , it will be the second time in two months a big french investment banking group has snapped up an insurance group .
that complex bid was billed as france ' s largest takeover ever - l ##rb - this one is slightly smaller - rr ##b - .
moreover , suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of societe general ##e de bel ##gi ##que .
par ##iba ##s officials , once considered france ' s tough ##est bankers , felt aba ##shed at suez ' s success and its rapid growth .
although par ##iba ##s denies it , analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between france ' s two largest investment banking groups .
it also reflects the broader pressure on companies in europe to keep up as the european community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by 1992 .
he also told reporters the acquisition would give par ##iba ##s fresh diversity , bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak .
navigation mix ##te has investments in a sugar company , a food and canning concern , a bakery and bus and truck ##ing firms , among others .
and navigation mix ##te has a huge hidden attraction .
payment by all ##ian ##z for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the french concern ' s treasury to an estimated 11 billion francs .
par ##iba ##s said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it .
this is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes .
mr . francois - ponce ##t responded that his group initially intended to take only a minority stake , striking an alliance with current management .
a bid against par ##iba ##s could n ' t be ruled out .
analysts said they do n ' t think it is contemplating a takeover , however , and its officials could n ' t be reached .
that level of production did n ' t take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter , when demand is traditionally strong .

this activity produced small rallies , which in turn attracted new short selling .
mr . sava ##iko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar , which would normally support the u . s . copper market .
such support usually comes from ar ##bit ##rage ##rs who use a strong british pound to buy copper in new york .
` ` the sell - off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong , ' ' he said .
copper has been stuck in a trading range of $ 1 . 19 to $ 1 . 34 .
mr . sava ##iko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $ 1 . 04 .
january platinum closed down $ 2 . 80 an ounce at $ 48 ##6 . 30 , nearly $ 4 above its low for the day .
december pal ##lad ##ium was off $ 1 . 55 an ounce at $ 137 . 20 .
platinum is believed to have good support around $ 480 and pal ##lad ##ium at around $ 130 .
some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report , which will be released today .
such sales are watched closely by platinum and pal ##lad ##ium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic convert ##ers .
he said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy pal ##lad ##ium again .
also weighing on both metals ' prices is the role of the chief supplier , the soviet union .
prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offset ##ting bull ##ish and bear ##ish news .
supporting prices was the announcement late friday of additional grain sales to the soviet union .
strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices .
world prices tumbled , mostly from their own weight , according to analysts .

but mr . sava ##iko expects stepped - up producer selling at around the $ 1 , 04 ##0 to $ 1 , 050 level .

today , the treasury will sell $ 10 billion of new two - year notes .
so far , money managers and other bond buyers have n ' t shown much interest in the ref ##corp bonds .
analysts have mixed views about the two - year note auction .
the company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an under ##writing group headed by first boston corp .
the issue yields 8 . 90 % and carries a guarantee covering 9 % of the deal from the company .
first boston sweet ##ened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort to place the huge offering .
the issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two - year treasury ##s .
the only asset - backed deal larger than ford ' s was a $ 4 billion offering by general motors acceptance corp . in 1986 .

short - term rates rose yesterday at the government ' s weekly treasury bill auction , compared with the previous bill sale .
the rates were up from last week ' s auction , when they were 7 . 37 % and 7 . 42 % , respectively .

thus , higher bidding narrows the investor ' s return while lower bidding widen ##s it .
the percentage rates are calculated on a 360 - day year , while the coup ##on - equivalent yield is based on a 365 - day year .
the 13 - week bills mature jan . 25 , 1990 , and the 26 - week bills mature april 26 , 1990 .

under the originally contemplated terms of the offering , the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above treasury ##s .
under the new plan being considered , the notes would reset annually at a rate to maintain a market value of 101 .
price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 1 \ / 4 % and 13 1 \ / 2 % .
activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment con ##du ##its announced and talk of several more deals in today ' s session .
part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that under ##writer ##s are rep ##ack ##aging mortgage securities being sold by th ##rift ##s .
traders said th ##rift ##s have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks .
in the mortgage pass - through sector , active issues rose but trailed gains in the treasury market .
a $ 57 ##5 million san antonio , texas , electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector .

the joint venture will have nominal capital of 50 million marks - l ##rb - $ 26 . 9 million - rr ##b - and 700 employees .
it will develop , produce and market high - performance electronic parts .
siemens is west germany ' s largest electronics group .
ae ##g is 80 % owned by dai ##mler - benz ag , the country ' s biggest industrial concern .
sales dropped 4 % to $ 1 . 12 billion from $ 1 . 17 billion .
the venezuelan currency plum ##met ##ed this year , making it difficult for auto makers there to afford imported parts .
dana also said it was hurt by slump ##ing u . s . truck sales and by a strike at a parts supplier .
the company , based in toledo , ohio , had said it expected reduced third - quarter profit .
mary anne sud ##ol , an analyst at fitch investors in new york , said automotive suppliers were reporting lower profit almost ` ` across the board . ' '
a ford official confirmed in tokyo that the u . s . motor vehicle maker is studying such an arrangement .
at age 19 , she was a paris sensation , transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade .
it is the stuff of dreams , but also of trauma ##s .
only the braves ##t spirits survive such roller coaster ##s .
and , for ms . baker , the ride was far from over .
but she did n ' t trust them and did n ' t reward trust .
as she saw one key love affair , the problem was n ' t her in ##fide ##lity , it was his jealousy .
she adopted 12 of ass ##orted races , naming them the rainbow tribe , and driving her husband first to despair and then to argentina .
finally , prince rain ##ier and princess grace saved her with the offer of a house in monaco .
baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 paris , where blacks had become exotic .
african art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathless ##ly of a dawn ##ing age to be inspired by blacks .
to be exotic was to be patron ##ized as well as prized , but for the most part paris was a friendly island in a racist world .
` ` one can hardly over ##em ##pha ##si ##ze the importance of her rear end , ' ' ms . rose writes .
still , even the title raises questions about the author ' s vision of her subject .
baker ' s art was jazz only by the wide ##st stretch of the term .
to find parallels , other than sexual appeal , with cleopatra , requires an equal stretch .
in fact , ms . baker played scenes in casablanca that could have made it into ` ` casablanca . ' '
the night the germans occupied all of france , baker performed in casablanca .
the free french wore black arm bands , and when she sang ` ` j ' ai deux amour ##s ' ' they wept .
ms . rose is best on the early years and world war ii .
it does n ' t help that sometimes ms . rose ' s language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want .
one chapter opens : ` ` world war ii was not one of france ' s glorious moments . ' '
one devoted fan who fell under baker ' s spell in 1963 and began collecting baker memorabilia was bryan hammond .
mr . les ##ca ##ze is foreign editor of the journal .
man ##ville , having rid itself of asbestos , now sells fiber ##glass , forest products , minerals and industrial goods .
but man ##ville ' s ownership is unusual , and it has caught the eye of some can ##ny - - and patient - - investors .
the denver - based concern , which emerged from bankruptcy - law proceedings late last year , is controlled by the man ##ville personal injury settlement trust .
when and if the trust runs out of cash - - which seems increasingly likely - - it will need to convert its man ##ville stock to cash .
` ` if they tried to sell , they ' d be chasing their own tail .
what makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a rec ##ap ##ital ##ization of all shares . ' '
the trust is n ' t commenting on when it might need to li ##que ##fy its man ##ville stock .
however , the trust ' s cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims .
its cash and liquid securities fell by $ 338 million in the first six months of 1989 .
the trust also will receive $ 75 million a year starting in 1991 on a bond it holds from man ##ville .
and , beginning in 1992 , it will have a claim on as much as 20 % of man ##ville ' s annual net income .
even so , the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch .
- l ##rb - the average should drop over time , since the most expensive claims are being settled first - rr ##b - .
` ` at some point , we ' re going to need an in ##fusion of funds , ' ' a person close to the trust says .
even before then , the trust may be eager to un ##load man ##ville stock .
it does n ' t pay a divide ##nd , and this trust needs income .
moreover , with 88 % of its assets tied up in man ##ville , the trust is badly in need of divers ##ification .
` ` obviously , a diversified portfolio would have less risk , ' ' the person close to the trust says .
man ##ville itself does n ' t rule out a restructuring .
we understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , ' ' he says .
of course , one option would be for man ##ville to buy out the trust ' s shares - - which would do little to benefit public stock ##holders .
but the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before november 1993 .
and both the trust and man ##ville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tar ##red the man ##ville name .
thus , analysts say , the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt man ##ville ' s other shareholders .
even if there is no restructuring , man ##ville seems to be attractive long - term .
mr . bullock says 45 % of revenues are tied to construction .
analysts predict little or no near - term growth .
they are , nonetheless , high on man ##ville ' s management .
` ` it ' s one of the best in the business , ' ' says sal ##omo ##n brothers analyst stephen do ##bi .
and he says man ##ville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible moment when other construction - related firms are hurting and selling cheap .
so far , as a price - conscious shop ##per , man ##ville has n ' t bought much .

yesterday , in composite trading on the american stock exchange , vermont american common closed at $ 39 . 75 , off 25 cents .
an ft ##c spokesman said the matter is ` ` in a non - public posture at this time ' ' and declined to comment further .
emerson and bosch , through their joint acquisition arm , maple acquisition , have begun a cash tender offer for all of vermont ' s common shares outstanding .
the offer , set to ex ##pire nov . 1 , may be extended pending the timing and resolution of the ft ##c request , the companies said .
st . louis - based emerson and stuttgart - based bosch make electrical and electronic products , including power tools .
the vermont american acquisition is designed to enhance their position in the accessories portion of the power - tool industry .
the plan places an indicated value on the real estate operation , santa fe pacific real ##ty corp . , of $ 2 billion .
santa fe pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today , according to people familiar with the transaction .
if approved , the sale is expected to close by year ' s end , with the spin ##off occurring by the end of 1992 .
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday , santa fe pacific closed at $ 20 . 625 , down 25 cents .
a spokesman said the properties survived without significant damage in last week ' s northern california earthquake .
a spokesman for chicago - based santa fe pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund .
the debt - laden parent has been under pressure from large shareholders to boost the company ' s share price .
at the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze .
the california pension fund ' s planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual .
pension funds rarely own as much as a 20 % stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company .
in addition , pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns .
but fund officials said the santa fe pacific real ##ty investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with california properties .
the spun - off concern ` ` clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio , ' ' he said .
real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $ 71 . 9 million from $ 143 million a year earlier , the company said .
that would help reduce santa fe pacific ' s remaining debt to about $ 600 million from a high of $ 3 . 7 billion in early 1988 .
the real ##ty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors , among other possibilities .
the santa fe pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect , saying the deal was still under negotiation .
santa fe pacific real ##ty owns 2 . 8 million acres of property , including 219 buildings with more than 11 million square feet of space .
among those are the 1 , 850 acres in the san francisco bay area , including 208 acres in the mission bay area .
the fund is the nation ' s largest public employee fund , and it has a growing cash flow now topping $ 3 billion a year .
ga ##f , part iii is scheduled to begin today .
the ga ##f trials were viewed as preview ##s of the government ' s strength in its cases against mr . lewis and mr . bi ##lz ##erian .
mr . jeff ##eries ' s performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing .
but ga ##f ' s bell ##we ##ther role was short - lived .
meanwhile , a federal jury found mr . bi ##lz ##erian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in june .
a month later , mr . jeff ##eries was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government .
in august , mr . lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts .
nevertheless , the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the ga ##f case .
the mist ##rial ##s have left the reputation ##s of ga ##f , mr . she ##rwin and ga ##f chairman samuel hey ##man in limb ##o .
for mr . she ##rwin , a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ 250 , 000 fine on each count .
ga ##f faces potential fines of $ 500 , 000 for each count .
for now , defense attorneys are tight - lip ##ped about their plans .
dal ##kon shield claim ##ants hope to stop reorganization - plan appeal .
the dispute pits two groups of claim ##ants against each other .
more than 100 , 000 claims against robin ##s are pending .
the company made and marketed the dal ##kon shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries .
american home products corp . wants to acquire robin ##s , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted .
the supreme court is scheduled to consider the case nov . 3 and may issue a decision as early as nov . 6 .
jury ' s criminal conviction under super ##fu ##nd law is a first .
criminal convictions under the federal super ##fu ##nd law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case .
environmental lawyers say virtually all of the super ##fu ##nd cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to ins ##ure cleanup of past poll ##uting activities .
but super ##fu ##nd also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment .
in 1986 congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony .
he was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building , a violation of the clean air act .
the government sought a criminal penalty because ` ` no cleanup is possible here .

another murderer on death row has appealed mr . simmons ' s death sentence in a ` ` next friend ' ' capacity .

west ##ame ##rica has about $ 1 . 3 billion of assets and is the largest independent bank in northern california .
it controls about 35 % of the affluent marin county market across the golden gate bridge from san francisco .
mr . decker ' s resignation surprised many industry officials .
he was brought to the company in september 1988 after 15 years at los angeles - based first interstate banco ##rp .
the bank had been suffering in late 1987 from a sl ##ew of bad real estate loans made in arizona .
its stock also has risen lately , at least partly because it is considered a possible takeover candidate .
in american stock exchange composite trading yesterday , west ##ame ##rica closed at $ 22 . 25 a share , down 75 cents .
the diversified electronics company blamed the decline in the quarter ended sept . 29 , on previously reported operating problems in its electron devices & systems group .
sales for the year rose almost 15 % to $ 1 . 34 billion from $ 1 . 17 billion last year .
it said it will exercise that right only if it sells substantially all of its other core businesses .
it also can sell the right to regain the subsidiary to another party .
also , the broker - dealer subsidiary , integrated resources equity corp . , was renamed royal alliance associates inc .
because of integrated ' s widely reported troubles , the unit ' s representatives had been requesting a name change .
royal alliance , to which the 3 , 900 representatives ' licenses will be transferred , is a shell company integrated owns .
integrated will pump $ 3 . 5 million to $ 4 million into royal alliance as initial funding .
if integrated regain ##s royal alliance , the representatives will retain their 49 % ownership .
the subsidiary is n ' t expected to be profitable for at least one year .
if integrated regain ##s the unit , it would receive any profit the unit reports , even while the unit is independent .

many aspects of the agreement were worked out wednesday in chicago , when integrated senior managers met with about 150 representatives .

it was the kind of s ##nu ##bbing rarely seen within the congress , let alone within the same party .
it was offered as an expression of cooperation to mr . gonzalez , who is investigating the $ 2 . 5 billion failure of lincoln savings & loan association .
but instead of thanks , sen . cr ##ans ##ton was treated with cool formal ##ity .
` ` every witness receives a formal sub ##po ##ena , ' ' rep . gonzalez told him .
unlike many law ##makers , chairman gonzalez says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper .
and he has attached himself to the lincoln story ten ##acious ##ly .
` ` unless the questions are answered , i will keep on going . ' '
law ##makers often are reluctant to em ##bar ##ras ##s colleagues , even those of opposing political parties .
he comes from the same political line as wright pat ##man , a bank - bait ##ing texas pop ##uli ##st who chaired the banking committee until 1974 .
mr . gonzalez is also a stick ##ler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honor ##arium ##s and who believes in conducting official business in the open .
the immediate target of rep . gonzalez ' s inquiry is danny wall , chairman of the office of th ##rift supervision .
mr . wall relieved them of responsibility for supervising lincoln in 1988 .
mr . gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to washington by mr . wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance .
mr . wall , however , is a self - proclaimed ` ` child of the senate ' ' and former staff director of its banking committee .
they all attended a meeting in april 1987 questioning why a federal audit of lincoln s & l had dragged on for two years .
` ` there are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators . ' '
all the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent .
mr . keating lives in phoenix , and the california th ##rift ' s parent is an ohio - chartered corporation with holdings in michigan .
chairman gonzalez expresses sympathy for sen . ri ##eg ##le , his counterpart as chairman of the senate banking committee .
` ` he ' s wise , he ' s good and i know he ' s an honest man , ' ' the tex ##an says .
most importantly , the senate traded away the bush administration ' s controversial plan to finance the bail ##out , which was partly reinstated later .
now mr . gonzalez is holding the equivalent of rec ##on ##firm ##ation hearings anyway , under the guise of the lincoln investigation .
` ` in a way , that ' s what this is , ' ' mr . gonzalez con ##cede ##s .
even some house banking committee members could suffer from the fallout .
but the chairman ' s supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ 1 . 1 billion fraud suit against mr . keating and others .
a witness set to testify on thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying lincoln ` ` lau ##nder ##ed ' ' campaign contributions illegally .
but the witness , william crawford , california ' s chief state th ##rift regulator , denies saying that .
but he said he is prepared to testify that executives of lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions .
the committee also has summoned mr . wall ' s predecessor , edwin gray .
when anne vol ##ok ##h and her family immigrated to the u . s . 14 years ago , they started life in los angeles with only $ 400 .
not surprisingly , she quickly adapted to the american way .
three months after she arrived in l . a . she spent $ 120 she did n ' t have for a hat .
but i loved tu ##rba ##ns . ' ' - rr ##b -
it ' s being sold through bookstore ##s , news ##stand ##s and some video stores .
now , for example , she owns 48 hats .
with obvious satisfaction , she says she told him : ` ` no darling , i just give it a chan ##el look . ' '
she keeps track of the rest of her hats by st ##ap ##ling polar ##oid snaps ##hot ##s to the outside of each hat ##box .
` ` you have to be born with it .
i used to wear hats in russia , but i had to make them and my dresses .
on the hat side i was n ' t getting what i wanted . ' '
now 48 years old , ms . vol ##ok ##h has definite ideas about what she wants .
` ` if you are born to give parties , you give parties .
in los angeles , in our lean years , we gave parties . ' '
she has thrown extravagant so ##ire ##es for crowds of people , but prefers more intimate gatherings .
` ` at american cocktail parties everyone ' s always looking over your shoulder to see who they can talk to next .
i like rather tea , because it is at the end of the day . ' '
she serves high russian tea , at 5 p . m .
` ` it ' s supposed to be later but i just moved it .
in los angeles , it ' s important to catch people just after work . ' '
she also frequently invites directors , producers , actors , writers and other show business people for ` ` coffee and clips in the pleasure dome . ' '
they eat ` ` sin ##ful and sensual things ' ' - - and explain their clips .
` ` it ' s very revealing and soul bari ##ng , ' ' said ms . vol ##ok ##h .
mr . k ##rut ##chen ##sky approached ms . vol ##ok ##h five years ago about backing the publication , which started out as a listing guide .
she was interested only if she could guide it editorial ##ly as well .
` ` anne does n ' t believe in bland ##ness , ' ' said ms . smith .
and she has this in ##ex ##haus ##ti ##ble energy .
she ' ll think of an idea the editorial people think is impossible , then she ' ll have us make it work . ' '
in fact , ms . vol ##ok ##h was n ' t just a rich lady who needed a hobby .
back in the soviet union she was a respected journalist , writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for sunday i ##z ##ves ##tia .
` ` look at dos ##to ##ev ##ski and ka ##fk ##a .
no one ever eats in their books and look at them . . . .
to ##ls ##toy ' s characters eat , push ##kin ' s , go ##gol ' s . ' '
in life , she offers practical diet ##ing advice : ` ` divide your meals into important and un ##im ##port ##ant .
in a great restaurant , do n ' t de ##pr ##ive yourself .
the other meals do n ' t matter . ' '
amusing as she is , and fr ##ivo ##lous as she can seem , this is a serious person with some difficult memories .
her mother was a translator ; her father was ` ` the eternal vice director . ' '
` ` i emigrated to wear better hats , do better parties , ' ' she said with a giggle .
` ` but we should n ' t leave out political reasons , number one .
you try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances .
one can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives . ' '
ms . vol ##ok ##h quit her job , to remove herself from the public eye .
their visa came in relatively short order , and they moved to los angeles .
` ` that ' s always looking back , ' ' she said .
` ` i wanted to be in business . ' '
when her husband and son founded their computer company , ve ##so ##ft , she worked as business manager , book ##keeper and public ##ist .
now movie ##line is located in the same building as ve ##so ##ft .
` ` things work out unexpectedly in life , ' ' said ms . vol ##ok ##h .
` ` you never know if you ' ll be chosen to be the sc ##ape ##go ##at or the lucky one .
` ` it ' s an extremely complex market , and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment , ' ' mr . forrest ##er says .
` ` we are not trying to encourage everyone . ' '
executives say mr . go ##rba ##chev ' s moves to break up the government ' s foreign trade monopoly have created uncertain ##ties as well as opportunities .
changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of inexperienced soviet players , many who promise more than they can deliver .
as part of that attempt , by the american trade consortium , mr . gi ##ffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying .
growing public fears about the soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint - venture plans .
the plans have come under fire from soviet environmental ##ists , and officials say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped .
whatever the difficulties , mr . go ##rba ##chev remains committed to increasing foreign trade .
the u . s . ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures , behind west germany , finland and italy .
judging by the crush at the exhibition , deprived soviet consumers are more than ready for u . s . products .
some u . s . products are filtering into the soviet market under an emergency import program .
both col ##gate and pro ##cter & gamble have received big orders for tooth ##pas ##te , soap and deter ##gent ##s .
but the current soviet purchasing sp ##ree may be a one - time affair .
the goal of most u . s . firms - - joint ventures - - remains elusive .
international competition for the few soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up , however .
some u . s . entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale .
one group seeks to publish a u . s . - soviet medical journal in conjunction with the u . s . s . r . ministry of health .
it will be financed by advertisements from u . s . companies and by simultaneous publication of an english - language journal containing details of soviet medical advancement ##s .
` ` we found a market niche , ' ' mr . mills boasts .
general electric co . was given an $ 89 . 6 million navy contract for nuclear propulsion parts .

the move will give nu ##ovo banco a badly needed foreign presence , and make credit ag ##ric ##ole the bank ' s largest shareholder .
it also opens a rift in the bank ' s shareholders ' syndicate that could lead to a battle for control of the concern .
credit ag ##ric ##ole asked a milan court to se ##quest ##er the nu ##ovo banco shares , the italian news agency an ##sa reported .
the tribunal is scheduled to rule on the request friday .
credit ag ##ric ##ole officials could n ' t be immediately reached for comment .
since then , the bank has strengthened its italian network , and has posted strong results .
gem ##ina said in a statement that ` ` it reserves the right to take any action to protect its rights as a member of the syndicate . ' '
a company spoke ##sw ##oman said the company had n ' t decided what measures to take , but did n ' t rule out legal action .
a general ##i spokesman declined to comment on nu ##ovo banco ' s rejection of the ins ##urer ' s offer .
on the milan stock exchange , nu ##ovo banco ' s shares jumped to 4 , 83 ##0 li ##re each from 4 , 69 ##5 li ##re friday .
qin ##te ##x australia has n ' t disclosed its borrowing ##s , but analysts estimate the company ' s debt at a $ 1 . 2 billion .
he said the move will ` ` significantly reduce administrative and operating costs , ' ' but he did n ' t provide details of the merger .
analysts predicted that the move would further shake credit ##or confidence in qin ##te ##x australia and force it to sell assets .
mr . ska ##se ' s statement was addressed to the stock exchange and appeared to be a response to the inquiry .
it said qin ##te ##x entertainment owes qin ##te ##x australia us $ 38 . 1 million in loans not secured by specific assets .
qin ##te ##x australia also said it has an investment of a $ 83 . 3 million in qin ##te ##x entertainment shares .
yesterday ' s statement did n ' t say whether the japanese companies will acquire qin ##te ##x ' s remaining stake in the resorts .

mr . ska ##se ' s statement cited four recent problems that he said had cut group cash flow by more than a $ 200 million .
qin ##te ##x australia has n ' t yet reported results for the fiscal year ended july 31 .
qin ##te ##x australia paid the management company a $ 32 . 6 million in the latest fiscal year .
non - executive directors of qin ##te ##x australia , who must approve payments to the senior executives , bal ##ked at the amount .
two of the directors resigned , mr . ska ##se said , so the payments have n ' t yet been approved .
chip ' s memory is here today , here tomorrow
two companies plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off .
the chips use materials , such as lead z ##ir ##cona ##te titan ##ate , to form microscopic switches that retain their data without electricity .
developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology is n ' t fully refined .
but ram ##tron of colorado springs , col ##o . , plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple fe ##rro ##ele ##ctric chips in december .
national semiconductor is getting fe ##rro ##ele ##ctric technology from k ##rys ##alis corp . in albuquerque , n . m .
once production hurdles are overcome , the chips could take over a significant part of the market .
in addition to not needing an outside power source , they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips .
military buyers have shown interest , national says , because fe ##rro ##ele ##ctric chips resist atomic radiation .
an austin , texas , company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town .
witnesses often must travel long distances to give face - to - face deposition ##s before lawyers and court reporters .
and telephone or video ##ta ##pe deposition ##s just do n ' t match physical encounters .
that could change , thanks to lower long - distance rates and cheaper electronics .
the company installed a prototype system that connects dallas with miami over digital phone lines .
and it is preparing to set up shop in chicago , new york and 10 other cities where court - reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network .
while lawyers arranged individual tie - ups before , the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper .
japan ' s mis ##use of u . s . patents has been a sore point for american chip makers .

computer chips that simulate human vision have been developed by japan ' s sharp corp .
sharp says the set of chips could improve fa ##x machines , graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features . . . .
an n . v . philips unit has created a computer system that processes video images 3 , 000 times faster than conventional systems .
the results , which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat - to - lower earnings for the big electronics retailer , disappointed analysts and traders .
tan ##dy ' s stock fell $ 1 . 375 a share to close at $ 44 in new york stock exchange composite trading .
tan ##dy had 86 . 3 million shares outstanding at sept . 30 , down from 90 million a year earlier .
revenue rose 5 % to $ 98 ##6 million from $ 93 ##7 million .
tan ##dy said consumer electronics sales at its radio shack stores have been slow , partly because of a lack of hot , new products .
sales at radio shack stores open more than a year grew only 2 % in the quarter from a year earlier , he said .
tan ##dy earned $ 88 . 8 million , or $ 3 . 64 a share , in the year ended june 30 .
mr . bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help tan ##dy ' s results improve in the important christmas quarter .
` ` they ' ve been promising 13 % to 15 % growth based on the strategic moves they ' ve made , ' ' he said .
` ` if the earnings acceleration is to take place , that should be the quarter .
mr . joseph conceded the junk market was in di ##sar ##ray , according to people familiar with the discussion .
the dinner was a stark confirmation that 1989 is the worst year ever for the $ 200 billion junk market .
and investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take years to resolve .
amid the market disorder , even dr ##ex ##el , which has the wide ##st and most loyal following of junk bond investors , is pulling in its horns .
for many money managers , the past four months have been humiliating .
since the end of last year , junk bonds have been out ##per ##formed by all categories of investment - grade bonds , including ultra - safe treasury securities .
at that point , the junk market went into a tails ##pin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell .
in an interview , mr . joseph says his dinner discussion with the pr ##ude ##ntial executives acknowledged problems for junk .
and , del ##tec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation .
` ` in fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , ' ' del ##tec said .
` ` i have no reason to think things will get worse , but this market has a kn ##ack for surprising us .
this market teaches us to be humble . ' '
the junk market ' s ` ` yield hog ##s are learning a real painful lesson , ' ' he says .
` ` but we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse .
and the risks are n ' t appropriate for us , ' ' he says .
the big ins ##urer , unlike pr ##ude ##ntial , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds .
his study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
still , the list of troubled dr ##ex ##el bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on wall street , as does its successful offerings .
` ` quality junk bonds will continue to trade well , ' ' says michael holland , chairman of sal ##omo ##n brothers asset management inc .
` ` but the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste .
but mrs . bo ##eh ##m did n ' t mention any of them .
like which are drop ##pa ##ble and which are not .

` ` it can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society . . . .

i knew it was someone important , so i followed her into the ladies room and sure enough , it was liza .
some people must drop names - - call it an irresistible impulse .
` ` after all , war ##hol was the ultimate named ##rop ##per , dropping five a day in his diaries .
and beau ##re ##gard was mentioned twice - - although very briefly and in passing . ' '
mr . rev ##son , the gossip columnist , says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party .
these drop ##pers do n ' t fl ##au ##nt only their friendships with the trump ##s , brooke astor or george ##tte mo ##sb ##ache ##r .
` ` it ' s the one - ups ##manship of name - dropping that counts . ' '
but name - dropping has other benefits , often civic .
some people call it ` ` the mistake on the lake ' ' - - lake erie , that is .
` ` power names like that do n ' t hurt the city ' s reputation , ' ' mr . miller says .
in hollywood , an average family can gain cache ##t from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous .

press agents and public - relations practitioners are notorious name - drop ##pers .
and some even do it with malice af ##ore ##th ##ough ##t .
len ke ##ssler , a financial public ##ist in new york , sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him .
he admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions .
there are , of course , obvious dangers to b ##lat ##ant , un ##su ##bs ##tan ##tia ##ted name - dropping .
` ` get caught and you ' re dead in the water , ' ' says mr . tha ##l .
mr . tha ##l says that elizabeth taylor , a client , ` ` hates being called ` liz . ' . . .
if directors or producers phone me and say they know ` liz , ' i know they ' ve never met her .
and her husband sometimes calls her ` ` duck ##y . ' '
that ' s because they only drop ` ` mere names , ' ' says mr . churchill .
` ` when you ' re at the club , you ask whether they ' ve spoken to ` g . '
now they know who you mean and you know who you mean .
now that ' s name - dropping , if you know what i mean .
twenty years ago , in the infancy of suburban sp ##ra ##wl , just a handful of dealers ##hips were here .
the 1980s have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in america , in everything from phone companies to cola ##s .
and especially , as the cobb parkway strip at ##test ##s , in cars .
for car market ##ers , it has become a much tough ##er battle to keep loyal customers from defect ##ing to one of the new makes on the block .
for american car buyers , the proliferation of choice is both li ##ber ##ating and confusing .
he says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today , and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a well - defined image .
he says it ' s important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company ' s quality image .
some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice out ##weig ##h the draw ##backs .
` ` but the reward is that there ' s less need to make trade ##offs ' ' in choosing one ' s wheels .
jean ##ene page , of north salt lake city , utah , likes the broader selection .
she wants something big , and already has looked at the chrysler new yorker and lincoln town car .
` ` that seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grand ##ki ##ds to the lake , ' ' she says .
the legendary gm chairman declared that his company would make ` ` a car for every purse and purpose . ' '
now there are many cars for every purse and purpose .
just four years ago , gm planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments .
today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans .
for every brand like renault or fiat that has been squeezed out , others such as is ##uz ##u , dai ##hat ##su and mitsubishi have come in .
detroit tries to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own .
ford motor co . created the mer ##kur name ##plate in 1985 to sell its german - made touring sedan ##s in the u . s . .
but slow sales forced ford to kill the brand just last week .
when consumers have so many choices , brand loyalty is much harder to maintain .
the wall street journal ' s ` ` american way of buying ' ' survey found that 53 % of today ' s car buyers tend to switch brands .
it ' s hard to general ##ize , but age seems to be the best predict ##or .
adults under age 30 like sports cars , luxury cars , convertible ##s and imports far more than their elders do .
perhaps most striking , 35 % of households headed by people aged 18 to 44 have at least one foreign car .
that ' s true of only 14 % of households headed by someone 60 or older .
generally , imports appeal most to americans who live in the west and are well - educated , affluent and , especially , young .
such preferences persist even though many americans believe differences between imported and domestic cars are dim ##ini ##shing .
some 46 % give foreign cars higher quality ratings , down from 50 % two years ago .
on the other hand , only 42 % say foreign cars are less comfortable than u . s . models , down from 55 % in 1987 .
people in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger americans are to brand switching .
but out on cobb parkway , ted ne ##gas sees it differently .
thus the very fi ##ckle ##ness of baby boom ##ers may make it possible to win them back , just as it was possible to lose them .
the battle for customer loyalty is evident along the cobb parkway strip .
ed vo ##yles olds recently established a special section in the service department for owners whose cars are less than a year old , so they get quicker service .
manufacturers , too , are stretching further to lure buyers .
some 60 % of the survey respondents said they would buy anti - lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag .
more than 50 % felt the same way about air bags .
in contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo - charged engines had little appeal .
but even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days .
the reason : items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today ' s .

program trading on the new york stock exchange in september rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume .
a daily average of 20 . 9 million shares traded in program strategies in september , the second - highest level ever .
the highest level was in june 1989 , when a daily average of 22 . 1 million shares traded in program strategies .
average daily trading volume in june of 180 . 3 million shares was considerably higher than in september .
program trading amounted to 12 . 3 % of average daily volume in june .
the big board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks .
it ' s the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market .
overall , sal ##omo ##n reported program trading volume of 75 . 2 million shares .

otherwise , they ' d be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color tv ##s .
a similar machine already on the market , made by rank sin ##tel ltd . , a unit of rank organisation , costs about $ 500 , 000 .
and the potential market is tremendous , industry experts say .
demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations .
and mr . nile ##s , the program producer , contend ##s that ko ##dak ' s move is ` ` a sound marketing decision .
they ca n ' t afford to stay out of hd ##tv . ' '
hd ##tv ##s break down images into more than 1 , 100 lines , compared with 525 for today ' s television ##s , providing considerably sharpe ##r detail .
and the sets are wider , resembling the dimensions of a movie screen .
but the financial rewards are n ' t expected soon , nor are they guaranteed .
some critics say they wo n ' t be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price .
nevertheless , ko ##dak could n ' t risk letting hd ##tv turn its motion - picture film business into a dinosaur .
` ` ko ##dak understands hd ##tv is where everybody is going , ' ' says ri ##t ' s mr . spa ##ull .
but this time it ' s hurting opposition as well as ruling - party members .
and as it un ##fold ##s , it ' s revealing some of the more tangled and seam ##ier aspects of japanese society .
this time , the scandal centers on donations made by the not - quite - mainstream pac ##hin ##ko parlor industry .
pac ##hin ##ko , a kind of pin ##ball , is japan ' s favorite form of legal gambling .
recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe .
to many japanese , pac ##hin ##ko is benign or en ##tic ##ingly un ##sa ##vor ##y .
ga ##rish neon pac ##hin ##ko mar ##que ##es blaze from the main streets and narrow alley ##s of cities and towns across the country .
if that money were being tax ##ed , it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen .
in 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tough ##er restrictions .
then , in 1988 , a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prep ##aid cards for pac ##hin ##ko was fielded in parliament .
in august , a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pac ##hin ##ko industry organization donated money to japan socialist party members .
the chosen sore ##n and the j ##sp immediately denied the report .
and at first , neither the opposition nor the ld ##p wanted to pursue the issue .
but the press kept it alive ; as with the recruit scandal , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money .
within a matter of weeks , less - conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling ld ##p had received much larger donations from pac ##hin ##ko organizations .
so far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the ld ##p members received amounted to bribes .
no one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal .
direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign , but both groups deny making direct donations .
they say it s possible some of their members may be dona ##ting privately .
the issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent korean residents , those residents were largely born and raised in japan and many speak only japanese .
many japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians , the way many japanese do , to win favor or support .
both residents ' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad .
when robert mc ##du ##ffie was 14 , he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in macon , ga .
unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by it ##zh ##ak per ##lman the same night , and she was adamant about his attending .
` ` i threw such a fit , ' ' says mr . mc ##du ##ffie , who had begun violin studies at the age of six .
` ` but once per ##lman started playing , i did n ' t give a damn about basketball . . . .
afterwards , i went home and practiced for three hours . ' '
today , it ' s obvious that the bra ##wny , six - foot , one - inch musician made the right choice .
at 31 , mr . mc ##du ##ffie has a rich , full - bodied tone , an ad ##mir ##able rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule .
later this season he gives a recital at washington ' s kennedy center , and appears as soloist with several major orchestras .
yet mr . mc ##du ##ffie ' s career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries .
` ` but i was n ' t ready for a career at that time . ' '
young mc ##du ##ffie ' s first violin teacher was henrik schwarz ##enberg ##er , a hungarian refugee who taught in the macon public school system .
` ` he taught me how to play like a gypsy , ' ' jokes the musician .
` ` i did n ' t learn to count until i got to ju ##ill ##iard . ' '
` ` i think i had to prove myself to her , ' ' says mr . mc ##du ##ffie .
she only put her foot down twice , ' ' he continues .
` ` in my freshman year , my roommate was known as a party animal .
she thought i was n ' t getting my practicing done . ' '
the second incident took place after mr . mc ##du ##ffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself .
miss delay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital .
that ' s the only note that ' s truly in tune . . . ' . ' '
now , when i play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my into ##nation . ' '
` ` he did n ' t say much , but what he said was important because it ' s not in the score .
the only time the violin has it is right at the end .
it ' s written ` marc ##ato ' in the score , and i played it that way , kind of gig ##ue - like .
and he yelled out ` do ##lce ! do ##lce ! ' - lc ##b - ` sweet ! sweet ! ' - rc ##b - . ' '
` ` so we did it over , ' ' he adds .
` ` i played very transparent ##ly , with the tip of the bow .
if a conductor is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra - lc ##b - volume - rc ##b - at that point , it makes the piece magical .
i do n ' t know why barber never told anybody else .
on isaac stern ' s recording it ' s very biting . ' '
since leaving ju ##ill ##iard , mr . mc ##du ##ffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones .
his guest appearance on the nbc soap opera ` ` another world , ' ' scandal ##ized musical eli ##tist ##s .
mr . mc ##du ##ffie ' s sweet tone , heart ##felt lyric ##ism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works .
aided by the fluid playing of the st . louis symphony under leonard sl ##at ##kin ' s direction , this ` ` serena ##de ' ' really swings .
but there are ample rewards in its plain ##tive slow sections and vi ##rt ##uo ##so fireworks for soloist , brass and tim ##pani .
his performance was so e ##ff ##us ##ive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed .
the 35 - member sin ##fo ##nia played ad ##roi ##tly with a big , lush sound that bel ##ied its size .
` ` a normal person did not write the beethoven ` violin concerto , ' ' ' he declares .
` ` even when i hear it played badly , i ' m still humble ##d by the piece .
if i could ever feel i ' ve contributed to it in some way , then all the hard work has been worth it . ' '

however , these figures do n ' t seem to worry thomas a . du ##rkin , an economist at the federal reserve board .
he adds : ` ` we are now witnessing a slow ##down which , if history is a guide , could persist for a while . ' '

maiden ##form inc . loves to be intimate with its customers , but not with the rest of the public .
` ` we are a vanishing breed , ' ' he muse ##s .
mrs . coleman , 73 , who declined to be interviewed , is the maiden ##form st ##rate ##gist .
sales have triple ##d during her 21 - year tenure to about $ 200 million in 1988 .
maiden ##form says it is very profitable but declines to provide specific ##s .
you never know where she ' ll turn up . ' '
three days later , mr . les ##k was named president and chief executive officer of olga co . , a competing intimate apparel division of warn ##aco inc .
warn ##aco also owns warner ##s , another major intimate apparel maker .
mr . les ##k could n ' t be reached to comment .
but maiden ##form officials say that after spending 24 years at maiden ##form , mr . les ##k , 48 , made it clear he wanted the top job .
the company down ##play ##ed the loss of mr . les ##k and split his mer ##chan ##dis ##ing responsibilities among a committee of four people .
` ` my style is less informal , ' ' mr . bra ##wer says .
top officers insist maiden ##form ' s greatest strength is its family ownership .
` ` you ca n ' t go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart , ' ' one delight ##s .
` ` it is fun competing as a private company , ' ' mr . bra ##wer says .
` ` you can think long range . ' '
other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way .
warn ##aco was taken private by spectrum group in 1986 for about $ 48 ##7 million .
and last year , play ##te ##x holdings inc . went private for about $ 680 million .
when he gets calls , ` ` i do n ' t even have to consult ' ' with mrs . coleman , mr . mask ##et says .
the company could command a good price in the market .
mr . bra ##wer ' s wife , catherine , and robert st ##roup , elizabeth ' s husband , round out the five - member board .
each has an equal vote at the monthly meetings .
` ` we are all very ami ##able , ' ' mr . bra ##wer says .
executives say mrs . coleman is very involved in the day - to - day operations , especially product development .
in the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales .
while mr . rosenthal introduced new under ##gar ##ment designs , his wife , ida , concentrated on sales and other financial matters .
the name maiden ##form was coined by a third business partner , en ##id bis ##sett .
the company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the u . s . , puerto rico , other parts of the caribbean and ireland .
as a senior vice president , he has headed the company ' s designer linger ##ie division , oscar de la rent ##a , since its inception in 1988 .
to maintain ex ##cl ##us ##ivity of that designer line , it is n ' t labeled with the maiden ##form name .
mrs . coleman ' s husband , joseph , a physician , succeeded mrs . rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in 1968 .
a country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports .
the $ 14 billion of reserves china had in june would cover just that much .
but before import growth slowed , china ' s buying sp ##ree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign - exchange reserves .
the $ 14 billion level in june marked a drop from $ 19 billion at the end of april .
china ' s last big import bing ##e sent reserves tumbling to $ 10 . 6 billion in june 1985 from $ 16 . 6 billion the previous september .
but this time , china faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the tian ##an ##men square killings june 4 .
for example , china ' s hard - currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since june 4 .
revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $ 1 . 3 billion , down from $ 2 . 2 billion last year .
the western government report suggests a number of scenarios for china ' s current - account balance , two of which are considered most likely .
in 1985 , china had a record deficit of $ 11 . 4 billion .
the other scenario assumes that beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months .
but since june , foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to china .
even if borrowing resume ##s , commercial bankers are n ' t expected to lend as much as before .
in addition , economists are forecast ##ing a slow ##down in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of china ' s deteriorating political and economic environment .
on top of all this , foreign - debt repay ##ments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992 .
with less capital coming in , china ' s balance of payments would suffer .
the western government report ' s first scenario assumes a 30 % reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5 % contraction in foreign direct investment .
in the second , foreign borrowing is projected to grow 10 % and investment to drop 10 % .
in the first scenario , the reserves would be exhausted next year , and in the second they would be wiped out in 1991 .
the company reported good gains in all of its divisions .
carr - low ##rey , a maker of glass bottles for the cosmetics and toilet ##ries industries , had sales last year of about $ 40 million .
new can ##aan investments is a closely held investment partnership with interests primarily in the packaging industry .
ralph brown was 31 , 000 feet over minnesota when both jets on his falcon 20 flame ##d out .
at 13 , 000 feet , the engines restarted .
but he flies for federal express corp . , perhaps the closest thing in corporate america to the green be ##ret ##s .
federal ' s employees work long hours and seem to thrive on the stress of racing the clock .
like mr . brown , they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that over ##ar ##ching corporate goal : delivering the goods on time .
it has also rattled federal ' s strongly anti - union management , which is already contend ##ing with mel ##ding far - flung operations and with falling profits .
` ` in our formula , we do n ' t have any losers except the competition . ' '
what managers really fear is that the pro - union movement could spread beyond the pilots .
under federal transportation law , a government media ##tor is attempting to reconcile the mel ##ding of tiger ' s job classifications into federal ' s .
depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatch ##ers .
these groups constitute up to 10 % of its work force .
that culture , carefully crafted by mr . smith , leaves little , if any , room for unions .
since founding the company , the charismatic vietnam vet , who is still only 46 years old , has foster ##ed an et ##hos of combat .
mr . smith ' s managers have , at times , been called ` ` ho chi minh ' s guerrillas . ' '
competitors are known as the ` ` enemy . ' '
to reinforce employees ' dedication , mr . smith pays well .
he also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate gr ##ie ##vance procedure and , as a per ##k , fly free in empty cockpit seats .
and , with many of his 70 , 000 workers , mr . smith ' s damn - the - torpedoes attitude has caught on .
` ` we do n ' t just hand the customer the package .
that ' s just the beginning , ' ' he says .
` ` in essence , we run the show . ' '
david sanders , a longtime pilot , br ##istles at the mere suggestion that a union might tam ##per with his flight schedule .
` ` this is america , ' ' he says .
` ` nobody has the right to tell me how much i can work . ' '
such attitudes have given federal flexibility , not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extra ##ord ##ina ##rily lean .
the company deliberately under ##sta ##ffs , stretching employees ' schedules to the limit .
pilots , as well , routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are fur ##lou ##gh ##ed during seasonal low ##s .
labor problems are the last thing mr . smith needs right now .
although the tiger acquisition has brought federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be , it also has brought problems .
federal , on its own , had n ' t been doing very well overseas .
it had hem ##or ##rh ##aged in its attempt to get into asia , where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes half - empty on certain routes .
on routes to south america , the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were grounded .
in europe , business suffered as federal bought several local companies , only to have the managers quit .
earnings have plum ##met ##ed , too , in each of the past three quarters .
federal ' s stock price , however , has held up well , driven in part by the general run - up of airline stocks , analysts say .
they closed friday at $ 53 . 25 , down 50 cents on the day .
there ' s a certain irony in the fact that federal express faces its first union problems as a result of its tiger purchase .
in the early 1970s , mr . smith modeled his fledgling company on tiger ' s innovation of hub - and - spoke and container ##ized - cargo operations .
but from early on , tiger ' s workers union ##ized , while federal ' s never have .
federal express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually .
until then , they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue cr ##im ##ping profits .
for now , the union issue is the most net ##tle ##some of federal ' s tiger problems , management believes .
although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , mr . smith does n ' t count ##ena ##nce what he considers ins ##ub ##ord ##ination .
he then made most of the changes , pilots say .
that sort of approach , however , has n ' t worked since the addition of tiger .
when the pilots refused , the company retracted it .
mr . smith angered federal ' s pilots , too .
the tiger merger agreement stipulated that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure .
mr . smith is trying hard to alla ##y the anger .
and even some pro - union pilots say his char ##ism ##a and popularity among the many former military fl ##iers could be tough to beat .
mr . smith and other top federal executives have met with tiger workers in los angeles , ohio , new york , alaska , asia and europe .
recently , they have appeared every few weeks in talk - show type videos , counter ##ing pro - union arguments .
in one video , mr . smith defended his agreement to merge the pilot - senior ##ity lists .
he said mr . stein ##berg had insisted that the merger talks move quickly .
regulators , as well , might have qu ##ash ##ed the deal if tiger ' s pilots had n ' t been protected , he said .
furthermore , mr . smith added , ` ` our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice .
it does n ' t give any particular group the ability to veto change . ' '
the senior ##ity - list controversy , along with the job - classification dispute , has been turned over to the media ##tor .
the issue has also cost federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots .
such an ##imo ##sity could prove pivotal in the union vote .
a large majority of the 96 ##1 former tiger fl ##iers support the union , according to a union study .
the fight has turned ugly and , among pilots at least , has shattered the es ##pr ##it de corps that mr . smith worked so hard to build .
anti - union pilots have held ballot - burning parties .
some younger pilots say they have had to endure anti - union hara ##ng ##ues by senior pilots while flying across the country .
and for now , at least , the competition is n ' t the only enemy .
` ` the pilots are either for us or extremely against us , ' ' he says with a sigh .
ha ##rs ##co corp . said it obtained a $ 33 . 1 million export order for armored recovery vehicles and related support equipment .

he was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an imp ##ea ##chment trial .
conviction on any single imp ##ea ##chment article was enough to remove judge hastings from office .
he was found not guilty of three charges , involving accusations that he had improper ##ly disclosed information about a sensitive , government investigation .
the senate did n ' t vote on six lesser charges .
mr . hastings faced the senators and sat imp ##ass ##ively during the first two roll - call votes , then quickly left the chamber .
in an impromptu news conference on the capitol steps , he denounced the senators ' action .
` ` their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the fore ##fat ##hers ' teaching regarding imp ##ea ##chment , ' ' mr . hastings said .
for the future , he said he would run for governor of florida .
mr . hastings was appointed to the federal bench by president carter in 1979 and was one of the few black federal judges in the country .
while he packed the senate gallery with his supporters during some of the imp ##ea ##chment trial , most civil rights groups kept their distance from his case .
what next for the crust ##y fbi agent with the heart of gold ?
there are plenty of worse inspiration ##s for shows - - and most of them had already made the fall lineup :
a den mother raising some lo ##vable teen models .
a bunch of tan ##s and bathing suits posing as lo ##vable life ##guard ##s .
the opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of woman ##izing - l ##rb - a la john tower - rr ##b - .
when his secretary is found floating dead in the pol ' s pool , man ##cus ##o is called in to investigate .
in this week ' s show , there ' s an unsafe nuclear weapons ##making facility - l ##rb - a la rocky flats - rr ##b - .
if all of this seems a little stale , it ' s red ##eem ##ed in part by some tricky plot twists :
the usual suspects are found to be guilty , then not guilty , then guilty - - but of a different crime .
most of all though , the show is red ##eem ##ed by the character of man ##cus ##o .
he was n ' t protecting the freedom marche ##rs ; he was tail ##ing them as sub ##vers ##ives .
` ` back in 1964 , the fbi had five black agents .
three were cha ##uf ##fe ##urs for j . edgar hoover , and two cleaned his house . ' '
at the core of mr . log ##gia ' s man ##cus ##o is his world - weary tr ##uc ##ule ##nce .
he describes a reporter as ` ` miss first amendment . ' '
he describes a drowned corpse as ` ` esther williams . ' '
he ' s the kind of guy who rescues tram ##pled flags .
if ` ` man ##cus ##o fbi ' ' has an intriguing central character , it also has a major flaw :
to start , there ' s always a crisis - - and someone always worries , ` ` what if the press gets a hold of this ? ' '
at least once an episode we see protest ##ors marching around screaming slogan ##s .
at least once man ##cus ##o ' s boss yells ` ` in here - - now , ' ' and proceeds to dress his investigator down :
` ` you are a dinosaur . . . a hang ##over in a $ 10 suit . . .
one more word and you are out on a park bench , mister . ' '
in fact , throughout ` ` man ##cus ##o fbi , ' ' we do n ' t get words or lines - - we get speeches .
the scars will be here years after the polls close . ' '
in each show , man ##cus ##o gets to un ##lea ##sh similar hara ##ng ##ues :
` ` where the hell are they go ##n na live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump ?
and , at least once a show , someone delivers the line ` ` get off that soap ##box . ' '
now that ' s advice the writers should take to heart .
they have a series with a good character , some interesting , even occasionally surprising plot lines , and they ' re ruining it .
why , when a key witness disappears , does man ##cus ##o trash her apartment , tearing down dr ##apes , smashing walls ?
it ' s a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction , all to add more pizza ##zz to a script that ' s already over ##dos ##ing on pizza ##zz .
he bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away .
it was a profoundly moving moment for series television , and robert log ##gia ' s acting res ##onate ##d in the silence .
there ' s a pretty good program inside all the noise of ` ` man ##cus ##o fbi . ' '
if the show ' s creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little , they might just hear it .
tan ##a , which holds properties in 17 oil and gas fields in south texas , will provide tex ##aco with mostly gas reserves .
the fields contain recover ##able reserves of 435 billion cubic feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil .
tex ##aco has also been attempting to sell oil properties .
at least two years ago , the company put 60 million barrels of oil reserves on the block .
they were either too small or une ##con ##omic to maintain , the company said .
not all of those parcels have yet been sold .
tex ##aco , like many other oil companies , has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves .
penn ##zo ##il had sued tex ##aco for improper ##ly interfering with its acquisition of a portion of get ##ty oil co .
eventually , tex ##aco , which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation , settled its fight with penn ##zo ##il for $ 3 billion in 1986 .
completion of tex ##aco ' s acquisition of tan ##a is subject to government approval under the hart - scott - rod ##ino anti ##trust improvements act .

but mr . lip ##pen ##s said a rescue also could involve asahi mutual life insurance co . , which owns 5 % of ag .
a ram ##bu ##nc ##tious shake - up is quickly res ##ha ##ping europe ' s once - state ##ly insurance business .
in west germany and the netherlands , ins ##urer ##s are flirting with banks .
mr . lip ##pen ##s said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since mid - september .
but he estimated that a raider would have been able to ama ##ss no more than 4 % of the shares in recent months .
they have all ` ` very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of ag , ' ' he said .
any raider would find it hard to crack ag ' s battle ##ments .
a general ##e spokesman confirmed that the giant belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in ag should a raider seek control .
asahi officials could n ' t be reached for comment .
even without bid talk , this year ' s surge in prices for brussels real estate has excited interest in ag .
the company says those holdings constitute the third - biggest real - estate portfolio in belgium .
gen . sc ##ow ##croft was a member of the tower commission , which investigated the iran - contra affair .
during the coup attempt and its aftermath , ns ##c staff ##ers were ` ` stretched very thin , ' ' says one senior administration official .
` ` it ' s a very small shop . ' '
gen . sc ##ow ##croft does n ' t plan to increase the staff right now , but is weighing that possibility , the official adds .
by law , the council includes the president , vice president and secretaries of state and defense .
in practice , the director of central intelligence and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff also serve as unofficial members .
but the size , shape and role of the ns ##c staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide .
that task is one of washington ' s perennial problems .
administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n ' t a problem during the panama crisis .
but one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the ns ##c staff ##er most experienced in latin america , everett briggs , was gone .
the absence of mr . briggs under ##sco ##red the possible ina ##de ##qua ##cy of the current ns ##c staff .
both gen . sc ##ow ##croft and his deputy , robert gates , are experts in u . s . - soviet affairs .
gen . sc ##ow ##croft is particularly well - verse ##d in arms control , and mr . gates has spent years studying soviet politics and society .
both have become con ##fi ##dant ##s of president bush .
but neither has an extensive background in latin america , the middle east or asia .
in those areas , the role of ns ##c staff ##ers under them therefore have become more important .

bureau ##crats may deserve their bad reputation , after all .
he sent out thousands of news releases from his kensington , md . , office .
mr . les ##ko figured he would be flooded with entries by now .
after all , he says , ` ` we ' ve got like 15 million bureau ##crats . ' '
so far , though , mr . les ##ko has received only one entry .
mr . les ##ko , who is making the rules as he goes , has determined that bureau ##crats are eligible for nomination by other bureau ##crats .
but he says he would prefer to get nominations from rank - and - file folks .
he admits that he has n ' t had much luck generating free publicity for his contest .
newspapers , including this one , have generally ignored his news releases .
but mr . les ##ko ' s staff is beginning to wonder whether there is n ' t some larger phenomenon foil ##ing the contest .
` ` is the government not helping anybody ? ' ' asks toni murray , an assistant to mr . les ##ko .
mr . les ##ko himself is n ' t yet prepared to accept that explanation .
` ` people hate to write , ' ' he says .
` ` maybe people do n ' t believe i want to give this money away . ' '
maybe americans are just so annoyed with government that they are n ' t interested in admitting that bureau ##crats come in handy once in a while .
sa ##ab , meanwhile , is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sa ##gging car business .
sa ##ab said last week it ` ` has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers . ' '
among the possible suit ##ors is italy ' s fiat s . p . a , analysts said last week .
ford originally had seen a sa ##ab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the european and u . s . luxury car markets .
in addition , ford and sa ##ab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations .
but the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n ' t go far .
some european analysts speculated that officials of sa ##ab ' s highly profitable scan ##ia truck operation bal ##ked at surrender ##ing any of their autonomy .
industry analysts in europe said the most likely suit ##or for sa ##ab now is fiat .
last month , sa ##ab - scan ##ia chief executive georg ka ##rn ##sund said his company has had talks with fiat about a broader alliance .
but the talks yielded ` ` nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it , ' ' he said .
ford faces an up ##hill fight for jaguar , however .
jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with gm wrapped up by the end of the month .
gm , meanwhile , is hosting a delegation of members of the british parliament who are touring the auto maker ' s head ##qua ##rter operations in detroit .
a gm spokesman said the visit is n ' t connected to the jaguar situation .

the dallas cowboys are looking at a long - yard ##age situation , struggling to pull ahead of the atlanta falcons .
there in the center of the pack is quarterback troy ai ##km ##an , the key to the cowboys ' comeback strategy .
` ` he ' s a genuine wheat ##ies - box athlete , ' ' gus ##hes mr . jones .
the crowd groans , mr . jones shakes his head , the cowboys lose the game .
a few days after that sept . 17 game , mr . ai ##km ##an broke a finger , side ##lining him for weeks .
once fat and happy , the cowboys now are losing games , fans and money .
last year , the team ended up $ 2 million in the red on $ 30 million in revenue .
it has some of the highest costs in the league .
its attendance is off 23 % from six years ago .
` ` it ' s a vicious circle , ' ' says art model ##l , owner of the cleveland browns .
` ` one team pays so much and the other pays more .
we just do n ' t have that kind of income stream . ' '
all this is causing con ##vu ##ls ##ions in professional football .
though not intentionally , the cowboys ' mr . jones has come to represent this new breed of owner .
first , he un ##cer ##emon ##iously sacked tom land ##ry , the legendary coach who took the cowboys to five super bowls and 20 consecutive winning seasons .
in dallas , mr . land ##ry has a standing just shy of saint ##hood .
for mr . jones , it was just the beginning .
mr . jones calls the ranch ` ` the pentagon of sport ##dom . ' '
` ` i said , ` somebody come get me .
i ' m at extension 29 . ' ' '
with a new day dawn ##ing on the sport , mr . jones does n ' t see a place for this sort of luxury .
` ` it ' s just not cost efficient , ' ' he says .
the place costs nearly $ 2 million a year to maintain .
when he sells it , he says , the cowboys will move to a more practical - - read affordable - - grass practice field near texas stadium .
and as for tom land ##ry , well , in mr . jones ' s mind , he had played out his winning years .
after posting losing seasons in each of the last three years , the cowboys needed a change , he says .
football has long been mr . jones ' s passion , both on and off the field .
an arkansas native , he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 university of arkansas team that won a national championship .
so it was n ' t surprising that mr . jones returned to his arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for mr . land ##ry .
whatever mr . johnson ' s talents , in the hearts and minds of many dallas fans , he is no tom land ##ry .
in fact , the last time they played this badly was in 1960 , their opening season .
average attendance at their games , about 49 , 000 last year , continues flat .
mr . jones is attacking the problem on several fronts .
to try to draw more fans , he has dropped end - zone ticket prices from $ 25 to $ 19 .
but the general trend , given rising costs in the league , has been to raise prices , and mr . jones is expected to eventually follow suit .
` ` if we did n ' t increase prices , we ' d be in the red . ' '
the sales job seems to be paying off : when he bought the team , only six of the suites had been sold .
gate receipts are only the cowboys ' second largest source of cash .
the biggest is the nfl ' s contract with national television for broadcast of the league ' s games .
last year , the cowboys ' share of that pie came to $ 17 . 6 million .
the team additionally earn ##s between $ 2 million and $ 4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights .
mr . jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights .
he is also trying to get more stations in mexico , where the cowboys have a following , to pick up the games .
he calls the contracts ` ` critical to winning in the nfl ' ' and has played his part in the bidding wars .
this wage inflation is bleeding the nfl dry , the owners contend .
to tackle the problem , nfl owners have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries .
bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance .
the owners are trying to boost profit in other ways , too .
many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are rene ##go ##tia ##ting dated stadium contracts .
most of the owners must pay up to 10 % of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old .
in chicago , for example , size is the issue .
` ` we ' re in a metro area with millions of bear fans , and only a small number can be accommodated . ' '
when the lease ex ##pire ##s in 1999 , he says , ` ` it ' s got to be changed . ' '
and the league is trying to get more for its three - year national network contract , which ex ##pire ##s after this season .
the current contract pays the nfl $ 1 . 4 billion .
owners say they expect the league to demand a 50 % increase , despite the fact that televised football games have had lack ##lus ##ter ratings .
an nfl spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable tv companies like espn .
like the game of professional football , the nfl organization itself is in turmoil .
mr . fin ##ks is perceived by some owners as a standard - bearer for the old guard .
earlier this month , another effort to choose a commissioner failed .
for his part , jerry jones says he ' s in the business for the long haul , and his work style seems to support that .
to keep his schedule on track , he flies two personal secretaries in from little rock to aug ##ment his staff in dallas .
` ` when i made this investment , i made it on a lifetime basis , ' ' he explains .
` ` i ' m not here to make money by res ##elling the team later on .
while the cowboys may not be the best investment now , i do n ' t accept they ca n ' t be in the future . ' '
besides , to a large extent , mr . jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team , even though it keeps losing .
owning the cowboys has bought him en ##tree to a g ##litz ##y life that drilling for oil in arkansas just did n ' t provide .
a few weeks ago , mr . jones even entertained elizabeth taylor in his private suite at texas stadium .
` ` you ' re in the cat ##bird seat every day in this job , ' ' he says .
were not the pictures and happening ##s , which have been continuing news headlines , answers enough ?
mr . goldberg contend ##s that even as ` ` propaganda ' ' the film fails because it presents only one view .
of course the palestinians complain about their treatment ; of course the israelis feel put upon .
it ' s like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white south africans are .
well , ` ` days of rage ' ' airing with before - and - after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning .
this film attempts to show a side rarely seen in our media .
now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only .
president bush wants the pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across - the - board spending cuts that took effect last week .
that would give the pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has .
` ` that is n ' t consistent with the kind of discipline that gram ##m - ru ##dman is supposed to impose , ' ' he said .
the president ' s request did n ' t indicate how mr . cheney would shift the money .
a pentagon official said the request was made to give the department ` ` maximum flexibility ' ' to deal with the cuts .
that would give agencies ` ` less ability . . . to fu ##dge over things , ' ' he told reporters .
law ##makers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending deficit - cutting measure has been signed into law .

mr . o ' brien will elaborate on the si ##a ' s position in testimony before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee this week , a spokesman said .
i ' ve organized a series of exchanges , exhibitions and other continuing projects between cuban and american artists .
there is a simple reason for this : the cuban people .
let me immediately put limits to whatever nos ##tal ##gic notions that may intimate .
however , unacceptable though those occurrences may have been , they still provide no excuse for wholesale departure ##s from truth .
mr . as ##man should make distinctions among fide ##l , the army and the cuban people .
they are not interchange ##able , since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances .
we badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom .
without this basic level of attention to reality , our policies on cuba will continue to be as counter ##pro ##ductive as they have for 30 years .

investors bail ##ed out of new york city bonds in drove ##s last week , driving prices lower and boost ##ing yields .
one bond trader estimated that more than $ 50 million of new york city general obligation bonds were put up for sale friday alone .
` ` every broker has blocks of every size and maturity . ' '
- l ##rb - general obligation bonds are backed by the city ' s overall revenues and credit . - rr ##b -
although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled , many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold .
there have been reports for months that the city ' s economy is weakening , as the october 1987 stock market crash continues to make itself felt .
the recent sharp stock market decline ex ##ace ##rba ##ted those concerns .
meanwhile , tax revenues are falling while the city ' s spending needs are expanding .
in a study , the com ##pt ##roller said , ` ` the city ' s glory days are over . ' '
he charges the city ' s critics with spreading ` ` un ##founded emotional rhetoric . ' '
there are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis .
the leading contender for the mayoral office , democrat david din ##kins , has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs .
and the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election .
until last week , mr . din ##kins was considered a sho ##o - in .
until last week , ` ` everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election .
now , there have been a number of questions raised . ' '
last week , yields on long - term new york city general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point .
qin ##te ##x entertainment also said david evans , its president and chief executive , and roger kim ##mel , a director , both resigned .
mr . evans had been the de facto head of mgm \ / ua for months .
qin ##te ##x entertainment is 43 % owned by qin ##te ##x australia and said it relies on the australian company for funding its working capital requirements .
the stock traded as high as $ 10 this past summer .
the $ 5 . 9 million payment was due oct . 1 and the deadline for default was oct . 19 .
mr . lloyd said if qin ##te ##x had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ 92 million in debt under its loan agreements .
qin ##te ##x australia was ` ` saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation .
they continued to represent that to the board , ' ' said mr . lloyd .
` ` we were reassured they would stand behind the company . ' '
at that point , he said , qin ##te ##x australia stated it would ` ` endeavor to arrange ' ' the financing .
however a qin ##te ##x australia spokesman said his firm had never ` ` promised or guaranteed ' ' to make the payment .
the qin ##te ##x australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the chapter 11 filing .
he said the company believed qin ##te ##x entertainment ' s financial problems could have been resolved by other means .
the report of the bankruptcy filing stunned hollywood executives and investors .
mr . kim ##mel was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since 1980 .
the announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between qin ##te ##x australia and mgm \ / ua might be revived .
however , ` ` we are n ' t currently doing anything .
japan ' s finance ministry strongly denied playing any role in the new york stock - price free fall .
the ministry has never even suggested that japanese banks be cautious about leverage ##d buy - outs in general , mr . ut ##sum ##i said .
in general , mr . ut ##sum ##i said , japanese banks are becoming more ` ` independent ' ' in their approach to overseas deals .
san ##wa bank ltd . is one japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first ua ##l proposal .
a san ##wa bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank ' s decision .
` ` we made our own decision , ' ' he said .
all week there has been much speculation in financial circles in tokyo and abroad about the ministry ' s real position .
bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about japanese banks getting in over their heads .
japanese banks are under ` ` political pressure ' ' as well , the analyst said .
clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the japanese banks role in leverage ##d buy - outs .
despite mr . sum ##ita ' s statements , it is the finance ministry , not the central bank , that makes policy decisions .
while recent events may cool some of the leverage ##d buy - out fever , japanese banks are n ' t likely to walk away from the game .
despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for japanese banks to increase their presence in the u . s . market , bank analysts say .
flush with cash at home , but with fewer customers to lend to , leading banks are eager to expand overseas .
jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to leap ##fr ##og the problem of not having a strong retail - banking network .
france ' s national tobacco company , known for making brown - tobacco cigarettes such as gaul ##oise ##s and gi ##tan ##es , is branching out .
while se ##ita does n ' t own the french tab ##ac ##s , its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities .
one proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in paris .
once activated , the card would sit in the car ' s window , showing traffic warden ##s how much time the motor ##ist could remain .
when the motor ##ist returned to his car he could turn the card off and , if it showed time remaining , save it for later .
se ##ita is a partner in the project , which was developed by mat ##ra sa using japanese technology .
se ##ita and mat ##ra currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service .
it currently is considering bidding for swedish match co .
and it retains an interest in acquiring candi ##es and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops .
it also is trying to shore up its tobacco business .
brown - tobacco cigarettes such as gaul ##oise ##s now make up just 40 % of the french tobacco market , half the level of about two decades ago .
while se ##ita retains a manufacturing monopoly in france , it is being hurt by rising imports and from wan ##ing cigarette demand .
but the 5 - 4 ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities - - especially tres ##pass ##ing - - as on abortion rights .
the pre ##am ##ble says that human life begins at conception and that un ##born children have rights protected by the constitution .
the high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws .
the protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of un ##born children .
in another case , a protest ##er , ann o ' brien , was convicted of tres ##pass before the supreme court ' s webster ruling .
last week , when her appeal was argued before the missouri court of appeals , her lawyer also relied on the pre ##am ##ble .
roe vs . wade was the supreme court ' s 1973 decision that recognized a woman ' s right to abortion .
that would be an ironic result of a case in which the supreme court express ##ly stopped short of over ##ru ##ling roe vs . wade .
in two other cases , the possible consequences of the supreme court ruling appear even more un ##int ##ended .
a boone county judge rejected the motion , but daniel dod ##son , a jefferson city lawyer , says he has appealed .
in terms of sheer brutality , the somali regime of si ##ad barre may rank as no . 1 in the world .
the barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill .
up to 500 , 000 somali ##s have escaped to the relative safety of marxist ethiopia because of the behavior of president barre ' s troops .
guns were never used : each man was stabbed to death with a large knife .
the horrific details are only now emerging from a pains ##taking ##ly documented report , based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees .
not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks .
mr . barre ' s rule is crumbling fast .
mu ##tin ##ies wr ##ack his armed forces - l ##rb - really just an armed gang - rr ##b - , which control less than half the country .
on sept . 7 , i wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10 , 000 ethiopian soldiers by eritrea ##n and ti ##gre ##an guerrillas .
recently , in wo ##llo province in the center of ethiopia , ti ##gre ##an forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20 , 000 government troops .
mr . meng ##ist ##u is in an increasingly weak position : half his army is tied down defending the northern city of as ##mara from the eritrea ##ns .
the weaker he gets , the more he turns toward the u . s . for help .
what this all means in short ##hand is that soviet dominance in ethiopia is collapsing as fast as president barre ' s regime in somalia is .
what ' s more , the u . s . has suspended $ 2 . 5 million in military aid and $ 1 million in economic aid .
because the u . s . is still perceived to be tied to mr . barre , when he goes the runway could go too .
it is a certainty that mr . barre ' s days are numbered .
the u . s . should take care , however , that its own position in the country does not go down with him .
nobody is sure what will come next in somalia or whom the successor might be .
but as one expert tells me : ` ` whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than barre . ' '
ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated , secretive and byzantine in all of black africa .
there is simply no way to engineer a succession covert ##ly , as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent .
the only u . s . liability in the region is what remains of the link to mr . barre , and that should be cut fast .

op ##ec ' s ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets .
output from the organization of petroleum export ##ing countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out .
the organization is scheduled to meet in vienna beginning nov . 25 .
so far this year , rising demand for op ##ec oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others .
but that could change if demand for op ##ec ' s oil soft ##ens seasonal ##ly early next year as some think may happen .
at that rate , a majority of op ##ec ' s 13 members have reached their output limits , they said .
he puts op ##ec ' s current capacity at 28 million to 29 million barrels a day .
ali khalifa al - sabah , kuwait ' s oil minister , recently estimated op ##ec capacity at 25 million barrels a day .
either way , the over ##hang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge .
even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as saudi arabia and iraq , could upset the market .
previously , no op ##ec member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group ' s total output target , or ceiling .
libya accepted iran ' s proposal only so long as it was promised production par ##ity with kuwait .
and the united arab emirates , a chronic quota cheat ##er , refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways .
but the oil ministers continue to study the plan , and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month ' s meeting .
it ' s understood several compromise ##s already have been worked into the plan .
libya ' s previous conditions are no longer considered a problem , although the united arab emirates is still an issue .
saudi arabia , op ##ec ' s king ##pin , also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some op ##ec sources said .
insisting on a 24 . 5 % share of any ceiling , saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rat ##a distribution of increases to all members .
though tiny , that ' s a reduction in its share .
` ` under any circumstances , saudi arabia should get more ' ' rather than less , mr . na ##zer said .
the air force is to take at least 250 more .
officially , the statement is n ' t an attack on the raf ##ale .
ad ##m . go ##up ##il said that when the f - 18 ##s wear out , the navy is prepared to take raf ##ales to replace them .
but unofficially , senior navy officials sharply critic ##ize the raf ##ale as an air force plane ill - suited to carrier use .
although they never said so publicly , they have made no secret of their preference for the f - 18 on operational grounds .
so far , mr . das ##sau ##lt has resisted pressure to change .
what brought the naval issue to a head is that the crusaders are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to replace them .
a french crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here .
ad ##m . go ##up ##il rejected das ##sau ##lt ' s proposal to reno ##vate the crusaders , saying the cost was impossible to estimate .

for cat ##hay pacific airways , the smooth ride may be ending .
securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing cat ##hay ' s interim figures , believe more jolt ##s lie ahead .
fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through hong kong remains clouded by china ' s turmoil since the june 4 killings in beijing .
and tough competition in the air - freight market is cutting into an important side ##line .
these factors are further complicated by the airline ' s push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , ms . hall says .
ms . hall expects cat ##hay ' s profit to grow around 13 % annually this year and next .
cat ##hay is taking several steps to bo ##lster business .
in addition to aircraft from boeing co . , cat ##hay announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 airbus a ##33 ##0 - 300 ##s .
cat ##hay also is moving some of its labor - intensive data - processing operations outside hong kong .
some jobs already have been moved to australia , and there are plans to place others in canada .
david bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 .
cat ##hay is working to promote hong kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stop ##over .
although the june 4 killings in beijing have hurt its china flights , cat ##hay ' s other routes have retained high load factors .
cat ##hay officials decline to comment on the speculation .
` ` we think alliances are very important , ' ' mr . ed ##dington says .
` ` but we ' d rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else ' s .
i ' m not sure cross - ownership would necessarily make things smooth ##er . ' '
` ` but this way , american will coordinate good extensions to boston , new york , chicago and dallas .
we ' ll coordinate on this end to places like bangkok , singapore and manila . ' '
asian traffic , which currently accounts for 65 % of cat ##hay ' s business , is expected to continue as the carrier ' s main ##sta ##y .
cat ##hay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into china to 14 , and it is applying to restart long - canceled flights into vietnam .
further expansion into southern europe is also possible , says mr . bell , the spokesman .
and mr . ed ##dington em ##pha ##tically rules out a move to london : ` ` our life ##blood is hong kong traffic rights . ' '
he says the airline is putting its faith in the sino - british agreement on hong kong ' s return to china .
but critics fr ##et that post - 1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to beijing .
` ` cat ##hay would love to keep going , but the general sense is they ' re going to have to do something . ' '
` ` we ' re confident that it protects our route structure , ' ' he says , ` ` and our ability to grow and pro ##sper .

in the hard - hit marina neighborhood , life after the earthquake is often all too real , but sometimes surreal .
saturday night she din ##ed in an emergency shelter on salmon steak ##s prepared by chefs from one of the city ' s four - star restaurants .
at a nearby corner , they sw ##er ##ve per ##ilo ##usly close to a listing apartment house , oblivious to any danger .
a policeman shakes his head in amazement as he steer ##s them away .
- - a young woman who has been out of town shows up at the marina middle school to learn that her apartment is on the condemned list .
she is told she ca n ' t enter unless she is accompanied by an inspector .
nearby , five temporary residents of the school shelter sit on stool ##s , having their necks and backs kn ##ead ##ed by volunteer mass ##eus ##es .
the marina rescue center offered a very san franciscan response to the disaster .
she and some friends are considering offering earthquake victims free yoga classes and ` ` aroma therapy ' ' - - massage ##s with scented oils .
she finds the response of marina residents - - primarily yu ##pp ##ies and elderly people - - to the devastation of their homes ` ` incredible .
i do n ' t know if this would have happened somewhere else . ' '
out on the streets , some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15 - minute sc ##ave ##nger hunt through their possessions .
` ` it ' s so weird to have to decide what ' s really important to you , ' ' said barbara may .
in post - earthquake par ##lance , her building is a ` ` red . ' '
after being inspected , buildings with substantial damage were color - coded .
green allowed residents to re - enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes .
reds and yellow ##s went about their business with a kind of measured grim ##ness .
some frantically dumped belongings into pillow ##case ##s , others threw goods out windows .
it did n ' t help that on saturday , after three days of sunshine , it rained .
` ` the women wanted photo albums , a certain bro ##och , kind of sentimental things . ' '
he showed an unbroken , still - ticking pocket watch that he retrieved for one woman .
some residents def ##ied orders and returned to ` ` red ' ' buildings to retrieve goods .
a police ##woman had to be called in to make her leave ; the police ##woman helped carry out one last load .
enforcement of restricted - entry rules was sporadic , residents said .
one man trying to remove his car was told by officials to get out of his garage .
when he sneak ##ed back later to try again , a different policeman offered to help him get the car out .
the marina also has become the focal point of city efforts to reunite residents with any pets that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake .
on lamp ##post ##s along fill ##more street , a major marina artery , posters were offering a $ 100 reward for a cat lost during the quake .
the san francisco society for the prevention of cruelty to animals also has been providing medical care , food , water and foster homes for quake - displaced animals .
for example , one para ##kee ##t owner returning home found that her apartment , like many others in the marina , did n ' t have heat .
but turn into the shopping center ' s parking lot , and one could be in the safe , busy mall of a prosperous suburb .
the watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per lea ##sable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200 .
three other ha ##age ##n shopping centers in the watts area are doing almost as well .
major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom - and - pop operations offering poorer - quality merchandise at higher prices .
along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents .
thus there is even more to the vermont - sl ##aus ##on center than a good place to shop .
the center improves the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment .
this starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers .
and that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real estate , licenses and the like .
another benefit is that substantial percentage ##s of the proprietor ##s in these centers are minority businessmen and women .

security at a typical ha ##age ##n inner - city center is impressive , but uno ##bt ##rus ##ive .
the entire site is enclosed by a 6 - to - 8 - foot - high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote - controlled gates .
shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non - fortress - like appearance .
infrared motion detectors and closed - circuit tv cameras monitor the entire center ; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard .
local law enforcement is present in a sub - station occupying space donated by the center .
these features are also used in mata ##nk ##y real ##ty group ' s grand boulevard plaza .
ha ##age ##n has its own large security force of well - trained and well - paid personnel on round - the - clock duty at each center .
security is 60 % to 70 % of the common area charges of these centers , vs . an industry average of about 15 % .
many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back .
however , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from en ##act ##ing legislation with similar provisions .
these programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it .
combat ##ting crime and the fear of it in inner - city commercial areas should give enterprise zones more success than most have enjoyed to date .

if growth regain ##s its glamour among investors , a slug ##gis ##h segment of the nas ##da ##q over - the - counter market could show some flash .
some stock pick ##ers already are targeting the ot ##c market , where , they say , await plenty of small - and medium - sized growth stocks .
against such a backdrop , companies with proven track records of earnings gains of 20 % or so annually have extra appeal .
among her ot ##c picks are os ##h ##kos ##h b ' go ##sh and a & w brands .
some like to special ##ize in growth companies whose shares have n ' t traded publicly very long .
these are sometimes dubbed ` ` emerging ' ' growth companies , though they also have expanding - profit track records .
while many growth stocks are small , not all small stocks have earnings - growth momentum .
mr . pali ##ck ##a ' s picks from the ot ##c market include leg ##ent , mail boxes etc . , and pay ##co american .
the main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy .
eventually , he believes , investors will be willing to pay higher prices for companies with proven track records of earnings growth .
in anticipation of that shift , he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now .
understand ##ably , smaller growth stocks have n ' t been in favor recently .
the average issue on standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index gained 35 % last year , ms . farrell of pain ##ew ##eb ##ber says .
smaller - stock earnings , by comparison , rose between 15 % and 20 % .
also , the smaller growth stocks are n ' t widely traded , and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips .

among his favorites in his firm ' s index are leg ##ent , silicon graphics and novel ##l .
however , more money managers are reassured that profit is regaining importance .
on friday , ham ##bre ##cht & qui ##st added st . jude medical to the list of 20 stocks it strongly recommends .

st . jude ' s market value on nas ##da ##q exceeds $ 1 billion , so it is n ' t a small stock .
the medical devices maker ' s earnings rose nearly 35 % in 1987 from 1986 , and 75 % in 1988 .

when first interstate bal ##ked , arguing that the figure was too high , regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $ 350 million .

conner dominates the market for hard - disk drives used to store data in laptop computers .
its revenue totaled $ 184 . 4 million , an increase of 172 % from $ 67 . 8 million a year ago .
revenue nearly triple ##d to $ 47 ##9 million , from $ 160 million .
that ' s a faster growth rate than reported by com ##pa ##q , which did n ' t post similar results until its fourth year , in 1986 .
but com ##pa ##q had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start - up .
conner ' s performance is closely tied to the bu ##rgeon ##ing demand for battery - operated computers , the computer industry ' s fastest - growing segment .
today , conner controls an estimated 90 % of the hard - disk drive market for laptop computers .
in the coming months , however , this is likely to change .
and the japanese are likely to keep close on conner ' s heels .
` ` they are going to catch up , ' ' said david cl ##ari ##dge , an analyst with ham ##bre ##cht & qui ##st .
both to ##shi ##ba and nec already produce hard - disk drives , and sony also is studying the field , mr . cl ##ari ##dge said .
yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebook ##s .
each of the three drives uses a mere 1 . 5 watts of power and one weighs just 5 . 5 ounce ##s .
` ` we continue to develop products faster than anyone else can . ' '
these new products could account for as much as 35 % of the company ' s business in 1990 , mr . conner estimated .
` ` we ' re not afraid of ob ##sol ##eti ##ng some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition , ' ' he said .
last week , for instance , com ##pa ##q introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews .
conner is supplying hard - disk drives for the machine , which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase .
the availability of these drives , in turn , boosted demand for laptop computers , whose useful ##ness had been limited because of lack of storage .
sales to com ##pa ##q represented 26 % of conner ' s business in its third quarter , compared with 42 % in the year - ago period .
move over , pornographic phone services : a legal service with a ` ` 900 ' ' number has been launched in california .
cane & associates to ##uts its $ 2 - a - minute service as the ` ` cheap ##est legal hour you ' ll ever find . ' '
though the service is available only in california , tel ##ela ##wy ##er founder michael cane says he plans to franchise it in other states .
mr . cane stresses that he is n ' t using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep .
` ` we will only deal with clients on the phone , ' ' he says .
` ` we have no in - office business . ' '
tel ##ela ##wy ##er is apparently the only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit .
local bar associations in some states have numbers that provide free tape - recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law .
there also are ` ` 800 ' ' hot ##lines which refer people to lawyers , usually personal - injury specialists , for in - office consultation .
when a caller reaches tel ##ela ##wy ##er by dial ##ing 900 - tel ##ela ##w , a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys .
there is no charge for research - - only for time on the phone .
if the matter requires further legal work or litigation , mr . cane says , his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm .
but he says cane & associates does n ' t receive refer ##ral fees .
so far , says mr . cane , most calls have involved landlord - tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and pro ##bate questions .
the firm is getting about 50 calls a day , and the average call lasts about 15 minutes .
out of the $ 2 charge , the law firm pockets about $ 1 . 55 .

the loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to wells rich .
benson & hedges has been one of its most high - visibility campaigns , as well as one of its largest clients .
the account billed almost $ 60 million last year , according to leading national ad ##vert ##iser ##s .
industry executives said philip morris had asked the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand ' s slipping market share .
the brand is no . 7 overall in the cigarette business , mr . maxwell said .
that ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing .
the brand early on achieved an upscale appeal - - a trait that some analysts believe is partly responsible for its st ##aid performance .
philip morris , trying to revive the benson & hedges franchise , put the account up for review in 1986 .

this city is gi ##rdi ##ng for grid ##lock today as hundreds of thousands of commuter ##s avoid travel routes ravaged by last week ' s earthquake .
estimates of damage in the six - county san francisco bay area neared $ 5 billion , excluding the cost of repairing the region ' s transportation system .
the bay bridge , the main artery into san francisco from the east , will be closed for at least several weeks .
part of the bridge collapsed in the quake , which registered 6 . 9 on the richter scale .
the bridge normally carries 250 , 000 commuter ##s a day .
also , most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south , the 101 freeway , have been closed for repairs .
bart has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for the onslaught .
most unusual will be water - borne commuter ##s from the east bay towns of oakland and berkeley .
for the first time in 32 years , ferry service has been restored between the east bay and san francisco .
that tariff is too stiff for some financial district wage earn ##ers .
` ` i ' ll stay with bart , ' ' said one secretary , swallowing her fears about using the trans ##bay tube .
officials expect the golden gate bridge to be swamp ##ed with an extra load of commuter ##s , including east bay residents making a long det ##our .
` ` we ' re anticipating quite a traffic crunch , ' ' said one official .
about 23 , 000 people typically travel over the golden gate bridge during com ##mute hours .
about 130 , 000 vehicles cross during a 24 - hour period .
meetings canceled by apple computer inc . ' s european sales force and by other groups raised the spec ##ter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants .
it also raised hack ##les of the city ' s tourism booster ##s .
city officials stuck by their estimate of $ 2 billion in damage to the quake - shocked city .
the other five bay area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $ 2 . 8 billion .
all estimates exclude highway repair , which could exceed $ 1 billion .
among the expensive unknown ##s are stretches of elevated freeway in san francisco that were closed because of quake - inflicted damage .
the most wo ##rri ##some stretch is 1 . 2 miles of waterfront highway known as the em ##bar ##cade ##ro freeway .
until it was closed tuesday , it had provided the quick ##est series of exits for commuter ##s from the bay bridge heading into the financial district .
engineers say it will take at least eight months to repair the em ##bar ##cade ##ro structure .
while many of these buildings sustained heavy damage , little of that involved major structural damage .
city building codes require construction that can resist te ##mb ##lor ##s .
` ` the extent of the claims wo n ' t be known for some time , ' ' mr . leach said .
california officials plan to ask congress for $ 3 billion or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low - interest loans .
the state has a $ 1 billion reserve , and is expected to add $ 1 billion to that fund in the next year .
however , state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum .

it has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block .
but in a tv interview sunday mr . bond said , ` ` we ' ve taken a big loss .
but we ' re out there and we ' re going to stay in business .
bond corp . signaled it will focus on building its domestic and international media and communications businesses .
the result ` ` will ultimately be a very different group in size and structure , ' ' bond corp . directors said in a statement .
the baker ##sfield supermarket went out of business last may .
the reason was not high interest rates or labor costs .
nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential in ##wood section of northern manhattan .
the business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers .
the owner was israel ortiz , a 29 - year - old entrepreneur and father of two .
in his first year of operating the store he bought for $ 220 , 000 , mr . ortiz was robbed at least twice at gun ##point .
the first time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside .
the second time he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged .
that was his reward for working until 11 p . m . seven days a week to cover his $ 3 , 000 a month rent .
for providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service .
israel ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year .
only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartender ##s and taxi drivers .
yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem .
recent data from new york city provide more of the picture .
a survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by interface , a policy research organization .
it gave 1 , 124 businesses a question ##naire and analyzed 35 ##3 responses .
crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving .
more than one - third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and lo ##iter ##ing near their premises .
in brooklyn and the bronx , one out of four commercial firms is bu ##rg ##lar ##ized each year .
industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with bu ##rg ##lary rates twice the city ##wide average .
crime is clearly more deadly to small - scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses .
he found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones .
the costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business .
whatever the monetary crime losses , they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury .
after repeated gun robber ##ies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives .
these findings illustrate the vicious cycle that national institute of justice director james k . stewart calls ` ` crime causing poverty . ' '
under ##class neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents .
small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses .
bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime .
the shift of retail ##ing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low - crime business environments .
private security guards and moonlight ##ing police can in ##vo ##ke the law of tres ##pass to regulate access to these quasi - public places .
since 1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 % .
few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants .
in the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection .
one is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses .
only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves .
a second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses .
only half the new york small businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response they receive .
some cities , including new york , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses .
but this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship .
another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small - business areas .
for cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits .
increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such ` ` hot spots ' ' of pedestrian density .
small - business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small - business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect .
while no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks .
it might even have saved the life , and business , of israel ortiz .

that reflects the huge drop a week ago friday , last monday ' s rebound and the dip ##s and b ##lip ##s that followed .
but several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market ' s slide .
funds that invest internationally were the top - performing stock and fixed - income funds .
` ` that means stocks , bonds , money market instruments and real estate . ' '
one week ' s performance should n ' t be the basis for any investment decision .
but the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets rough .
` ` it ' s like kicking the tires of a car . . . .
gold - oriented funds , for instance , which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal , posted an average decline of 1 . 15 % .
global allocation funds take the asset - allocation concept one step further by investing at least 25 % of their portfolio ##s outside the u . s . .
with all that going for them , global flexible portfolio funds declined only 1 . 07 % in the week through last thursday .
and friday the 13th notwithstanding , stocks have been this year ' s hot investment .
by comparison , global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about 19 % , while domestic flexible portfolio ##s are up about 17 % .
` ` that ' s the problem with trying to hedge too much , ' ' said mr . bro ##uw ##er .
` ` you do n ' t make any real money . ' '
some equity funds did better than others in the week that began on friday the 13th .
the $ 4 million mon ##etta fund , for instance , was the seventh top performing fund for the week , with a 2 . 65 % return .
its return so far this year has been a credible 21 . 71 % .
the fund ' s strategy is to sell when a stock appreciate ##s 30 % over its cost .
last monday , he started ` ` buying the high - quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices . ' '
among mr . ba ##care ##lla ' s picks : oracle systems , re ##eb ##ok international ltd . and digital microwave corp .
the fund ' s cash position is now about 22 % , which mr . ba ##care ##lla calls ` ` still bear ##ish . ' '
` ` in a downward market , bonds act better , ' ' he said .
` ` we still think there ' s a lot of un ##sett ##lem ##ent in this market .
we believe interest rates will continue to trend lower , and the economy will slow around the world . ' '
many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas , giving them the benefit of foreign currency translations when the dollar is weak .
but when the dollar rises against major foreign cu ##rre ##ncies , as it did for much of this year , the dollar value of these funds declines .
all three funds posted negative returns for the year to date .
there ' s either more to come or an extremely long period of dull ##ness . ' '
but investors do n ' t seem to think so .
several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy out ##flow ##s on the 13th .
vanguard group said it had a more than $ 50 million net in ##flow into its stock funds last week .
` ` there certainly has n ' t been a panic reaction , ' ' said steven nor ##witz , a vice president at t . rowe price associates .
` ` people showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying e ##qui ##ties . ' '

you may be hearing more about the 38 - year - old mr . mc ##don ##ough and his pre ##oc ##cup ##ation with clean air .
after years of relative ob ##scu ##rity , he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture .
he has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space .
he is now designing a broadway stage set for a show by the band kid creole and the coconut ##s .
what really stir ##s his muse , though , is aero ##bic architecture .
now the question is : is poland ready for it ?
the project has already acquired a certain new york cache ##t .
bloom ##ing ##dale ' s plans to sell a foot - tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays .
some of the sales proceeds will go to the design industries foundation for aids .
a cake topped with a replica of the center will be auction ##ed at an aids benefit at so ##the ##by ' s in december .
a 20 - story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space .
solar - powered batteries will make the spire glow .
the carpets wo n ' t be glued down , and walls will be coated with non ##to ##xi ##c finishes .
the news has n ' t exactly moved others in mr . mc ##don ##ough ' s profession to become architectural johnny apples ##eed ##s .
mr . mc ##don ##ough responds : ` ` i ' m asking people to broad ##en their agenda ##s . ' '
he earned a master ' s degree in architecture from yale .
his interest in the natural environment dates from his youth .
he and his father still spend time each summer fly - fishing for salmon in iceland .
living in hong kong , he says , made him sensitive to the limits on food , power and water supplies .
he and a dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in vermont .
at yale , he designed one of the first solar ##hea ##ted houses to be built in ireland .
the offices took 10 , 000 square feet of a building with 14 - foot ceilings and big , opera ##ble windows .
since the 1970s energy crisis , some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an un ##int ##ended side effect : high indoor pollution .

but , she says , ` ` i guess i did n ' t really notice the trees .
maybe they were hidden by all the people . ' '
neither the quilt ##ed gi ##raf ##fe nor the paul stuart renovation reflects much of mr . mc ##don ##ough ' s environmental concern .
the restaurant was conceived as a sparkling , crystalline ` ` geo ##de . ' '
it makes extensive use of stainless steel , silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terra ##zzo with zinc - strip floors .

its developer is a polish american , sasha mu ##nia ##k .
he had worked with mr . mc ##don ##ough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center .
if any nation can use environmentally benign architecture , it is poland .
the pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the middle ages .
after all , mr . mu ##nia ##k says , ` ` in poland there are n ' t too many people worried about the environment .
they ' re more worried about bread on the table .

pitt ##ston also owns brink ' s inc . , the security service , and burlington air express , the air - freight concern .
pitt ##ston continues to hire replacement workers , the company said .
burlington ' s operating profit grew to $ 9 . 2 million from $ 3 . 8 million a year earlier , pitt ##ston said .
brink ' s operating profit was about flat with the year - earlier period , reflecting continued pricing and cost pressures .
in new york stock exchange composite trading friday , pitt ##ston closed at $ 18 . 50 a share , down 12 . 5 cents .
does n ' t anybody here want to win this mayor ' s race ?
as they stumble and bum ##ble toward election day two weeks from tomorrow , both democrat david din ##kins and republican rudolph gi ##ulia ##ni are in trouble .
or ##dina ##rily , a clever opponent would find a way to capital ##ize on the other side ' s mis ##fort ##unes .
and now , at the crucial moment , he ' s running out of money .
this is the nation ' s biggest city and , traditionally , its mayor is the nation ' s best - known urban politician .
democrats hoped that mr . din ##kins could become a highly visible national leader .
but it has n ' t worked out that way .
` ` the alternative - - gi ##ulia ##ni - - is g ##has ##tly . ' '
` ` there ' s nothing on the other side . ' '
he adds : ` ` it just has n ' t gotten down to the engine room yet . ' '
but the steam may never reach the engine room .
for republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes , all of this is deeply frustrating .
historically , new york is almost always in trouble .
but the trouble it faces now under democratic rule seems bigger and more da ##unt ##ing than anything it has faced in the past .
this year , the city faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger next year .
and hardly surprising , many residents trying to cope with the city ' s other problems are constantly on edge , one ethnic group scrap ##ping with another .
` ` but , at least , back then they did n ' t generally direct their anger at each other . ' '
he defeated the contentious mr . koch in the democratic primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could heal the city ' s racial and ethnic wounds .
his general - election campaign is almost reagan - like , all muted pictures and comforting words .
his theme is unity , dec ##ency , humanity , bringing new york together again .
both candidates are negotiating about holding debates , but mr . din ##kins is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them .
the 45 - year - old mr . gi ##ulia ##ni has run a negative campaign to pick up votes leaning to mr . din ##kins .
` ` but our polls show voters do n ' t like the attack stuff .
why , even 20 % of the republican vote is going to din ##kins . ' '
for the gi ##ulia ##ni forces , it ' s a con ##und ##rum .
on the one hand , mr . gi ##ulia ##ni wants to cut into mr . din ##kins ' s credibility .
sh ##var ##tzer is a der ##oga ##tory yiddish word for a black person .
mr . din ##kins con ##cede ##s nothing in his ability to stumble and bum ##ble .
he can match jackie mason with his own robert ` ` sonny ' ' carson , an angry street organizer who was convicted of kidnapping in 1974 .
the din ##kins campaign paid mr . carson close to $ 10 , 000 to get out the vote on primary - election day .
paper work on how it was spent is incomplete .
mr . carson has been charged with being anti - semitic .
asked about that the other day , he replied , ` ` anti - semitic ?
more tr ##ou ##bling for mr . din ##kins is his record in personal accounting .
` ` i was always going to do it tomorrow , ' ' he explained at the time .
he had valued the shares at more than $ 1 million two years earlier .
he says he sold the stock to avoid conflict - of - interest problems in his role as a voting member of the city ' s board of estimate .
he says his son has n ' t paid for the shares .
` ` it looks like serious tax eva ##sion , ' ' says mr . ai ##les , the gi ##ulia ##ni media consultant .
` ` it follows the same pattern as his tax returns .
he waits to talk about it until after he gets caught . ' '
` ` the crime goes to character , ' ' says ron mai ##oran ##a , a consultant to the gi ##ulia ##ni campaign .
he ' s had a history of deception and this is the latest chapter . ' '
` ` the result may turn out to be a lot closer than people think .
banco am ##bro ##sian ##o , which was italy ' s largest private - sector bank , collapsed in 1982 with $ 1 . 3 billion of debts .

italian news reports said mr . carbon ##i and a colleague obtained 1 . 2 billion li ##re in checks from a vatican official , pavel h ##ni ##lica .
neither mr . h ##ni ##lica , mr . carbon ##i nor vatican officials could be reached for comment over the weekend .

indeed , win ##ne ##bag ##o said it started ` ` several promotional programs ' ' to spur retail sales in the fall and winter .
with the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 ' s robust sales .
at win ##ne ##bag ##o , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89 . 5 million from $ 95 . 4 million a year earlier .
the company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices - - two key expenses for rv buyers .
` ` it ' s a large - ticket discretion ##ary purchase , ' ' said robert curran , who follows the industry for merrill lynch & co .
and he said the weakness could continue in the first half of next year .

bull ##ish bond market sentiment is on the rise again .
as the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative .
and that , they say , will be good for bonds .
mr . platt is advising clients that ` ` the near - term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward . ' '
that would be comforting to fixed - income investors , many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the fed would ease .
investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall .
but when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the fed ' s credit - easing policy was on hold , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled .
long - term bonds have performed erratic ##ally this year .
now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloom ##y , and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins .
at the same time , last week ' s consumer price index showed that inflation is mode ##rating .
the federal funds rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the fed ' s credit policy .
` ` given our forecast for lower rates , purchases made now should prove quite reward ##ing before year end , ' ' he said .
mr . koch ##an also likes long - term , investment - grade corporate bonds and long - term treasury ##s .
tv ##a , in its first public debt offering in 15 years , sold $ 4 billion of long - term and intermediate - term securities last week .
strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion .
tv ##a , which operates one of the nation ' s largest electric power systems , is a corporation owned by the federal government .
today , the treasury department will sell $ 15 . 6 billion of three - month and six - month bills at the regular weekly auction .
tomorrow , the treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two - year notes .
all of this comes ahead of the government ' s big quarterly ref ##und ##ing of the federal debt , which takes place sometime in november .
so far , investors have n ' t shown much appetite for ref ##corp ' s initial bond offering .
` ` why should i bother with something that ' s an unknown for a very small pickup in yield ? ' ' he said .
` ` i ' m not going to jump on them the first day they come out . ' '
he seems to be typical of many professional money managers .
on friday , the yield was quoted at about 1 \ / 4 percentage point higher than the bench ##mark bond , an indication of weak demand .
some economists believe that yields on all treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply .
but once the new securities are digest ##ed , they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data .
` ` if one thinks that rates are going down , you do n ' t care how much supply is coming . ' '
most bond prices fell on concerns about this week ' s new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n ' t stage a sharp decline .
in early trading , treasury bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among japanese investors would continue .
those hopes were dashed when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance .
treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as 1 \ / 4 point , or about $ 2 . 50 for each $ 1 , 000 face amount .
the bench ##mark 30 - year bond , which traded as high as 102 1 \ / 4 during the day , ended at 101 17 \ / 32 .
the yield on the bench ##mark bond rose slightly to 7 . 98 % from 7 . 96 % .
traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12 % .
however , despite the big new - issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get done .
` ` there are about a dozen more deals coming , ' ' said michael mcnamara , director of fixed - income research at kemp ##er financial services inc .
` ` if they had this much trouble with chicago & north western , they are going to have an awful time with the rest . ' '
last week , under ##writer ##s were forced to post ##pone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market .
the coup ##on on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101 .
however , the maximum coup ##on rate on the issue when it is reset is 15 . 50 % .
de ##ben ##ture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in chicago & north western ' s parent company .
` ` the coup ##on was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to come in , ' ' said a spokesman for donaldson .
` ` we put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . ' '
the spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from japanese investors .

after several years of booming business with china , foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade .
foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then , choking liquid ##ity and ho ##bbling many projects .
and beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export - oriented plants strapped for cash .
gi ##va ##uda ##n far east ltd . , a swiss concern that sells chemicals to sham ##poo and soap factories in china , ty ##pi ##fies the problems .
last year ' s re ##tre ##nch ##ment dried up the working capital of chinese factories .
the company ' s sales flattened during 1989 ' s first half .
in canton , gi ##va ##uda ##n ' s representative office received no orders in june .
` ` things have grown worse since june 4 , ' ' mr . lai says .
he predict ##s that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year ' s $ 3 million .
but in general , all foreign - trading companies are feeling the pinch .
china ' s foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade .
the last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985 - 86 , when beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange .
the current trough is expected to be much deeper , because beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation .
in addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the june killings have been a big set ##back .
the picture for china ' s exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze .
the threat to china ' s balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign - exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings .
the reserves dropped for the first time in recent years , to $ 14 billion in june from $ 19 billion in april .
the trend has prompted beijing to int ##ens ##ify efforts to curb imports .
in recent weeks , china ' s leaders have recent ##ral ##ized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities .
the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses .
beijing ' s periodic cl ##amp ##down ##s on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping china export .
but the strategy is n ' t helping much this time .
he expects the company ' s trading business to drop as much as 40 % this year .
for a short time after june 4 , it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright .
many foreign trading offices in hong kong were swamp ##ed with tel ##ex ##es and telephone calls from chinese trade officials urging them not to se ##ver ties .
but when foreign traders tried to do business , they discovered that the eager ##ness of chinese trade officials was just a smoke ##screen .
the suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of china ' s national trading companies , which are among the country ' s biggest import ##ers .
business is n ' t any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders say .
shanghai investment & trust co . , known as sit ##co , is the city ' s main fin ##an ##cier for trading business .
sit ##co had custom ##ari ##ly tapped the japanese bond market for funds , but it ca n ' t do that any longer .
foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash .
` ` it has difficulties paying its foreign debts , ' ' says a hong kong executive who is familiar with sit ##co ' s business .
` ` how can it make available funds for purchases ? ' '
` ` there are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , ' ' he says .
these have been among the country ' s leading imports , particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dear ##ly .
but the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiral ##ing prices .
to stem speculation , beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year .
traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n ' t want to take a loss on res ##ales and are holding onto their stock .
the resulting stock ##pi ##ling has depressed the market .
but beijing ca n ' t cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without ham ##per ##ing the country ' s export business .
commercial fishermen and fish processors filed suit in federal court in a claim that has balloon ##ed to more than $ 104 . 8 million .

but the glacier bay case , the fund ' s first test , shows how easily the fund can be undermine ##d .
it claims the coast guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages .
that means the fund is n ' t ob ##liga ##ted to pay anything , at least so far .

high - definition television promises to be the tv of tomorrow , so it is a natural multi ##bill ##ion - dollar market .
although major u . s . manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to japan , not everyone here is ready to give up .
plan ##ar systems inc . of beaver ##ton , ore . , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual revenue , has similar plans .
it already has had success in electro ##lum ##ines ##cence , another promising technology adapt ##able for high - definition television .
the new technologies are intended to retire the cat ##ho ##de - ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional tv set .
large u . s . companies are interested in other segments of the hd ##tv business , such as signal - processing and broadcast equipment .
general electric co . recently sold off its interests in liquid - crystal displays to thompson - cs ##f of france .
` ` we found the market not developing as we thought it would , ' ' a ge spokesman says .

he says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that .
the bush administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in hd ##tv should be , is n ' t doing much for now .
the dar ##pa funds are a pitt ##ance compared with what japan and other prospective competitors are spending .
the commerce department estimates that japanese government and industry spending on hd ##tv research is already over $ 1 billion .
thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high - definition television has come from u . s . laboratories .
the panels are like oversized semiconductor ##s surfaced with a million or more picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a tv image .
in 1979 , however , west ##ing ##house abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television .

hd ##tv already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
the navy is ordering displays for its ae ##gis cruisers and the army wants smaller versions for its abrams battle tanks .
the commerce department also is trying to encourage hd ##tv because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries .
` ` the industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquire ##s a mass consumer market . ' '
each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial .
they also want u . s . trade policy to reflect the pentagon and commerce department ' s concern over their future .
and they want the u . s . to help them sell overseas .
` ` this is n ' t a technology issue , but an attitude issue , ' ' he says .

a year earlier , it had a loss of $ 199 , 203 or nine cents a share , on revenue of $ 7 . 6 million .
that sort of work ##horse performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of recent years .
the current flood of third - quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones .
the question for investors is , how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains .
that ' s the path of reasoning leading to growth stocks .
` ` i think it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market , ' ' says steven ein ##horn , partner at goldman sachs .
and they will again , say money - manager proponents of the growth - stock theme .
he also thinks foreign investors , who are showing signs of more disc ##rim ##inate investing , will join the pursuit and pump up prices .
` ` we ' re just seeing the beginning of a shift , ' ' mr . smith says .
mr . smith recommends cypress semiconductor that is currently showing a robust 63 % earnings growth rate .
mr . sloan praises the company as recession resistant and notes that it has an annual earnings growth rate of 32 % a year over the past five years .
others preach the gospel of buying only blue - chip growth stocks .
he recommends such blue - chip growth st ##al ##wart ##s as philip morris , pepsi ##co , cpc international , re ##eb ##ok international , and limited inc .
all have a five ##year earnings growth rate of more than 20 % a year .
some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle .
he recently trimmed his portfolio of international paper , dow chemical , quantum chemical , international business machines and digital equipment .
he is putting money in dress barn , circuit city stores , bruno ' s , and rubber ##maid .
big cyclic ##al companies are using ` ` all the tricks they can to stabilize earnings , ' ' says mr . sloan .
` ` what they are telling you is that they do n ' t have the ability to generate higher returns internally , ' ' says mr . sloan .
ibm says it considers its shares a good investment .
but not all st ##rate ##gist ##s or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclic ##als .
growth stocks may under ##per ##form cyclic ##al stocks next year if the federal reserve begins to let interest rates drift sufficiently lower to boost the economy .
goldman sachs ' s mr . ein ##horn , for one , sub ##scribe ##s to that scenario .
he suggests investors think about buying cyclic ##al shares in the weeks ahead , as well as growth issues .

the unit will be renamed coma ##ir aviation academy and will continue to be headed by scott williams , a son of its founder , coma ##ir said .
in the meantime , the question faced by investors is : what is ua ##l stock worth ?
the short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ 135 and $ 150 a share .
that ' s because airline earnings , like those of auto makers , have been subject to the cyclic ##al ups - and - downs of the economy .
at that level , and given the uncertainty , he believes ua ##l stock should trade closer to
by that logic , the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months , even though the eventual price might be higher .
on friday , they also persuaded the ua ##l flight attendants to join them .
banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk , that is , subordinate to the bank debt in any deal .
one obstacle to the pilots ' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership .
investors such as marvin davis of los angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they , not the pilots , must have control .
but it is n ' t clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders .
the lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied .
first boston ' s estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection .
and using liquidation value assuming the sale of all ua ##l assets , first boston estimated the airline is worth $ 253 to $ 303 a share .
unfortunately , all those estimates came before airline industry fundamental ##s deteriorated during the past month .
american airlines parent am ##r and usa ##ir group , both subject to takeover efforts themselves , have each warned of declining results .
some analysts do n ' t expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots .
the deal has , as one takeover expert puts it , ` ` so many moving parts .
i do n ' t see anybody who ' s sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving . ' '
in the meantime , the ar ##bs are bleeding .
that would indicate that the ar ##bs have paper losses on ua ##l alone total ##ling $ 72 ##5 million .

but the spokesman confirmed that sa ##at ##chi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its campbell - mit ##hun and rowland units .
he added , ` ` we have no intention of selling either business . ' '
the offers come as sa ##at ##chi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19 - year history .
analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak .
in the midst of the current turmoil , sa ##at ##chi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses .
it named a new chief executive officer , former im ##s international head robert louis - dr ##ey ##fus .
but sa ##at ##chi ' s troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses .
that would would make it appealing to a network such as inter ##pu ##bl ##ic that already has a healthy new york presence .

the disabled - workers bill - l ##rb - qu ##ack , qu ##ack - rr ##b - .
it comes up with a toned - down version of a democratic proposal .
the bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly , wondering where all the ` ` unexpected ' ' costs came from .
consider , for instance , the very fat f ##ow ##l known as federal ##ized child care .
the president came up with a good bill , but now may end up signing the awful bureau ##cratic creature hatch ##ed on capitol hill .
it would create 38 , 000 local day - care commissions , answer ##able to the department of health and human services .
they ' d determine where parents could store their kids during the day , and they ' d regulate the storage facilities .
the initial costs are said to be in the $ 2 billion a year range , but that ' s only the beginning .
new en ##ti ##tlement ##s tend to grow , creating a rational ##e for new taxes .
the house bill also di ##stor ##ts economic efficiency in all sorts of per ##verse ways .
for example , the administration proposal impose ##s extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants .
so instead of building more efficient modern plants , utilities stick scrub ##bers on the old plants .
the money spent on scrub ##bers is diverted from planned research on new , cleaner technology .
proponents of the nationwide standards say the cost for car buyers would be about $ 500 per car .

chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson ' s rest ##ated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a free ##fall in sterling over the past week .

the august deficit and the # 2 . 2 billion gap registered in july are topped only by the # 2 . 3 billion deficit of october 1988 .
at the same time , he remains fairly pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic about the outlook for imports , given continued high consumer and capital goods in ##flow ##s .
he reckon ##s the current account deficit will narrow to only # 1 . 8 billion in september .
however , mr . dil ##low said he believes that a reduction in raw material stock ##building by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports .
combined with at least some rebound in exports after august ' s unexpected decline , the deficit could narrow to as little as # 1 . 3 billion .
nevertheless , he noted , ` ` no one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position ' ' in the pound .
meanwhile , overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded .
u . k . base rates are at their highest level in eight years .
but consumer expenditure data released friday do n ' t suggest that the u . k . economy is slowing that quickly .
the figures show that spending rose 0 . 1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3 . 8 % from a year ago .
this compares with a 1 . 6 % rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5 . 4 % increase from the second quarter of 1988 .
analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than mr . lawson ' s promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary .
and , they warn , any further drop in the government ' s popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow .
sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in mr . lawson ' s promise friday .

major ship ##pers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years .
ship ##pers surveyed recently by ohio state university said they expect their freight - transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year .
the der ##eg ##ulation of railroads and truck ##ing companies that began in 1980 enabled ship ##pers to bargain for transportation .
carriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to over ##cap ##ac ##ity they were eager to fill .
` ` ship ##pers are saying ` the party ' s over , ' ' ' said mr . lal ##ond ##e .
` ` ship ##pers wo n ' t be able to look for transportation - cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years .
transport rates wo n ' t be an opportunity for offset ##ting cost increases in other segments of the economy . ' '
now we are starting to see real freight - rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor .
you ' ll see carriers try to rec ##ou ##p some of the price cutting that occurred previously . ' '
not everyone believes that the good times are over for ship ##pers .
railroad - rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail - traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks .
consolidated freight ##ways plans to raise its rates 5 . 3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases .
and ` ` ship ##pers are getting the feeling that they have played one truck ##er off against another as much as they can , ' ' he said .
air - freight carriers raised their rates for u . s . products going across the pacific to asia by about 20 % earlier this month .

bob stone stew ##ed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for ins ##ub ##ord ##ination .
mr . stone thought the discipline was unfair ; he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons .
unable to persuade the manager to change his decision , he went to a ` ` company court ' ' for a hearing .
at the scheduled time , mr . stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked .
after the three members of the court introduced themselves , the chairman of the panel said : ` ` go ahead and tell us what happened .
we may ask questions as you go along , or we may wait until the end . ' '
over a cup of coffee , mr . stone told his story .
the chairman promised mr . stone a decision within two weeks .
bob stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real .
it happened at north ##rop corp . in los angeles .
these firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what i call corporate due process .
although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies - - perhaps 40 to 60 - - it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry .
in the coming decade a majority of people - oriented companies are likely to adopt it .
corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons .
it reduces lawsuits from di ##sg ##run ##tled employees and ex - employees , with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations .
it increases employee commitment to the company , with all that means for efficiency and quality control .
what must your management team do to establish corporate due process ?
1 . make sure you have a strong personnel department .
at t ##wa , the system board of adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year , only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists .
at ci ##tic ##or ##p , the problem review board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel ' s skill in complaint - resolution .
in a typical year , up to 20 % of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment .
in a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle .
2 . formally or informally , train all your managers and supervisors in the company ' s due - process approach .
see that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it is the ` ` law ' ' governing company courts and ad ##ju ##dic ##ators .
coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately .
in the 15 companies i studied , reversal rates range on the average from 20 % to 40 % .
3 . decide whether you want a panel system or a single ad ##ju ##dic ##ator .
a panel system like that in the bob stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panel ##ists , mutual support .
international business machines and bank of america are among the companies using the single - ad ##ju ##dic ##ator approach .
4 . make your due - process system visible .
it wo n ' t do any good for anybody unless employees know about it .
most management ##s hesitate to go all out in advertising their due - process systems for fear of encouraging crank ##s and chronic sore ##heads to file complaints .
on the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbook ##s and talked up by personnel specialists .
smith - k ##line beech ##am goes further and sometimes features its gr ##ie ##vance procedure in closed - circuit tv programs .
naturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due - process system is for top management to support it .
at ibm , the company ' s open door system is sometimes the subject of memorandum ##s from the chief executive .

the u . s . is required to not ##ify foreign dictator ##s if it knows of coup plans likely to end ##anger their lives , government officials said .
the existence of the guidelines has become known since president bush disclosed them privately to seven republican senators at a white house meeting last monday .
according to the officials , mr . bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the white house discussing the guidelines .
they said the president conceded the notification requirement did n ' t affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month ' s panama coup effort .
the statement added , ` ` someone has regret ##ta ##bly chosen to selective ##ly sum ##mar ##ize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government .
not only does this come close to a violation of law , it violate ##s the trust we have all worked to develop . ' '
i ' ve invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee . ' '
sen . bore ##n said the committee could n ' t defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules .
but the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guide ##line was n ' t imposed on the white house by a med ##dling congress .
in fact , yesterday the administration and congress were still differing on what had been agreed to .
but a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the u . s . .
though the assassination ban is a white house order that congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation .
the new argument over the notification guide ##line , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed .

by 1980 , there were more than 100 such funds .
besides creating a vehicle for investors , money market funds also helped re ##write banking regulations .
the idea was to let small investors , the backbone of the fund business , deal in the money market ' s high short - term interest rates .
this had been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use six - figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the third or fourth decimal place .
the now - standard price of $ 1 a share came about by accident .
an early fund had filed a registration with the securities and exchange commission that included a fixed $ 1 price .
it arrived just as the regulator handling such operations was retiring .
his successor approved the $ 1 price in the process of clearing the backed - up papers on his desk .
keeping the listed price at a dollar is primarily a convenience .
actually , the funds do flu ##ct ##uate , but beyond the third decimal place .
eventually , the money funds ' success forced relaxation of curb ##s on bank interest rates to allow banks to offer competing yields .

it was a guts ##y move for a little - known executive , fired after only two months as president of his previous company .
but going against the grain has never bothered mr . andersson .
if the whole market thinks what you ' re doing is crazy you do n ' t have much competition . ' '
mr . andersson is anxious to strengthen tre ##lle ##borg ' s balance sheet .
characteristic ##ally , he did n ' t waste much time getting started .
the board had also been expected to approve a sk ##r ##1 . 5 billion international offering of new tre ##lle ##borg shares .
tuesday , the shares regained sk ##r ##20 , closing at sk ##r ##22 ##5 .
tre ##lle ##borg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 % of both units .
the spin ##off should solve a problem for the parent .
a family foundation set up by late founder henry dun ##ker controls 59 % of tre ##lle ##borg ' s voting shares outstanding .
but the foundation by ##law ##s require the entire tre ##lle ##borg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 % .
that possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance tre ##lle ##borg ' s rapid growth steadily dil ##uted the foundation ' s holding .
most of the new additions were barely profitable , if not outright loss makers .
the treatment turned tre ##lle ##borg into one of scandinavia ' s biggest and fastest - growing industrial concerns .
between 1985 and 1988 , sales multiple ##d more than 10 times and pre ##ta ##x profit surged almost twelve ##fold .
industry analysts suggest that the conquest of falcon ##bridge could vault tre ##lle ##borg from a regional scandinavian success story to a world - class mining concern .
` ` but we certainly like what we ' ve seen so far . ' '
but tre ##lle ##borg still must clear some tough hurdles .
mr . andersson acknowledges that the company ' s mining division ` ` will be busy for a while digest ##ing its recent expansion . ' '
but analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth .
mining is likely to remain tre ##lle ##borg ' s main business .
analysts say its chances of success will likely hi ##nge on how well tre ##lle ##borg manages to cooperate with nora ##nda in the falcon ##bridge venture .
nora ##nda and tre ##lle ##borg each came close to winning falcon ##bridge alone before the successful joint bid .
mr . andersson insists that tre ##lle ##borg and nora ##nda have n ' t discussed a falcon ##bridge break - up .
falcon ##bridge , he says , will continue operating in its current form .
` ` we ' d be reluctant to accept 50 - 50 ownership in a manufacturing company .
perhaps more important , both companies share mr . andersson ' s belief in the coming renaissance of base industries .
` ` if the 1980s were a decade of consumption , the ' 90s will be the investment decade , ' ' mr . andersson says .
` ` the whole of europe and the industrial ##ized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment , ' ' he says .
and investment is the key word for base metals , and most other businesses tre ##lle ##borg is in .
apple computer inc . posted improved fiscal fourth - quarter profit due largely to a $ 48 million gain on the sale of its stock in adobe systems inc .
proceeds of the adobe sale brought net income in the quarter to $ 161 . 1 million , or $ 1 . 24 a share .
apple shares fell 75 cents in over - the - counter trading to close at $ 48 a share .
fiscal fourth - quarter sales grew about 18 % to $ 1 . 38 billion from $ 1 . 17 billion a year earlier .
including the adobe gain , full - year net was $ 45 ##4 million , or $ 3 . 53 a share .
sales for the year rose nearly 30 % to $ 5 . 28 billion from $ 4 . 07 billion a year earlier .
` ` adverse pressure on gross margins . . . has subsided , ' ' mr . sc ##ull ##ey said .
margins in the fiscal fourth quarter per ##ked up , rising to 51 % from 49 . 2 % a year earlier .

the agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than $ 80 million .
mr . bin ##ce , the trust ' s associate executive trustee , declares the bidding a failure .
` ` it ' s getting harder to sell , ' ' he mutter ##s as he leaves the room .
indeed . recently , the trust failed to auction off the paper mill , a bank , an office building and a small cotton - gin ##ning plant .
of the four , only the bank and the plant drew bids - - one api ##ece .
two years later , mrs . aquino ' s promise remains largely un ##ful ##fi ##lled .
october is a critical month for the privatization program .
manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged .
all told , there are assets on the line valued at up to $ 1 . 03 billion .
the privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds .
much of the money from the sales is ear ##mark ##ed for a multi ##bill ##ion - dollar agrarian - reform program .
most recently , a lack of buyers has been added to the list .
rather than gathering momentum , the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets .
the ax ##iom appears to be that the more valuable the asset , the harder the privatization process .
` ` you just do n ' t see a whole lot happening , ' ' says an international economist .
to be sure , the program has n ' t completely stalled .
but its success has been largely in the sale of small , non ##per ##form ##ing companies , which are valued for their assets .
dealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has ho ##bbled the program in the past is popping up again .
ramon garcia , the asset trust ' s executive trustee , admits to what he calls ` ` temporary set ##backs . ' '
in light of the poor results recently , he says , the agency is adopting an ` ` attitude of flexibility . ' '
at the end of the month , the agency again will offer the bank .
but instead of a minimum price , only a target price will be established .
bankers say , however , that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price .
the bank has a negative net worth , they say .
in addition , special bidding rules give the bank ' s former owner , leonardo ty , the right to match the highest bid .
mr . ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash - strapped institution .
his ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers .
the price will depend on how much pic ##op shares fetch on the local stock market .
but according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill , price is n ' t the only consideration .
as it stands now , the government would continue to hold 45 % of pic ##op after the 36 % stake is sold .
- l ##rb - about 7 . 5 % of pic ##op is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity . - rr ##b -
mr . garcia acknowledges the problem and says the asset trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer .
under government regulations , however , foreign ownership of pic ##op ' s equity is limited to 40 % .
even though the government would retain the 45 % stake in pic ##op , critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners .
a series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short - changing the government over the pic ##op sale .

eagle financial corp . and webster financial corp . , two connecticut savings bank - holding companies , agreed to merge in a tax - free stock transaction .
the merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement .
in the merger , each share of webster , based in water ##bury , will be converted into one share of the new company .
each share of eagle , based in bristol , will become 0 . 95 share of webster \ / eagle .
in american stock exchange composite trading friday , eagle shares rose 12 . 5 cents to $ 11 .
in national over - the - counter trading , webster shares fell 25 cents to $ 12 . 375 .
webster has 3 . 5 million shares outstanding and eagle 2 . 6 million .
their indicated market values thus are about $ 43 . 3 million and $ 28 . 6 million , respectively .
harold w . smith sr . , chairman of webster , will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company .
ralph t . lin ##sley , vice chairman of eagle , will become vice chairman of webster \ / eagle .
the board will be made up of seven directors of each holding company .
in an interview , james smith said the banks ' ` ` markets are contiguous and their business phil ##oso ##phi ##es are similar and conservative . ' '

at june 30 , webster , which owns first federal savings & loan association of water ##bury , had assets of $ 69 ##9 million .
having said that , we must caution against an apparent tendency to overs ##tate the case .

how can a company be considered ` ` pri ##vati ##zed ' ' if the state is so heavily represented in it ?
' ' but the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in mexico ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure .
i refer essentially to petroleum , electric power , banking and news ##print .
those enterprises , however , are not going to be pri ##vati ##zed .
they are officially considered ` ` strategic , ' ' and their privatization is prohibited by the mexican constitution .

but to avoid the risk of rejection , the group does n ' t plan to submit the plan formally at a ua ##l board meeting today .
instead , the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board ' s reaction .
in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange , ua ##l closed at $ 168 . 50 a share , down $ 21 . 625 .
those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company .
for example , the group could offer $ 200 a share in cash plus stock valued at $ 30 a share .
ua ##l currently has 22 . 6 million shares , fully dil ##uted .
the new structure would be similar to a rec ##ap ##ital ##ization in which holders get a special divide ##nd yet retain a controlling ownership interest .
the difference is that current holders would n ' t retain majority ownership or control .
it was n ' t clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan , but employees would keep more than 50 % .
management ' s total could be reduced , and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been ear ##mark ##ed for british air .
one option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling - off period .

mr . k ##ren ##z is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him .
` ` with k ##ren ##z , we just do n ' t know what to expect . ' '
but he does n ' t appear to be ready to make broad changes either .
already last week , mr . k ##ren ##z started overhaul ##ing east germany ' s heavily ce ##nsor ##ed and notorious ##ly boring news media .
the regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of soviet - style g ##las ##nos ##t .
` ` it was quite a shock , ' ' says a 43 - year - old east german shop ##keeper .
` ` for the first time in my life , i was n ' t sure whether i was listening to our news or west german television . ' '
other changes , including easing restrictions on travel for east germans , are expected .
` ` i hope he grows with the job , ' ' says rainer ep ##pel ##mann , a protestant pastor in east berlin .
` ` the most important thing is that he have a chance . ' '
unlike mr . hon ##eck ##er , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , mr . k ##ren ##z enjoys asking questions .
he was later shown on television , fielding questions .
at one point , he asked a worker whether he thought east germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies .
the worker ' s tar ##t reply : ` ` it ' s more than just travel .
people have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . ' '
the exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to western news agencies .
this same tendency toward open ##ness impressed a group of visiting u . s . congress ##men this spring .
but there ' s another side to mr . k ##ren ##z .
born in a baltic town in an area which is now part of poland , he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus .
he moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron , mr . hon ##eck ##er , and emerged as the heir apparent .
even if he is , she adds , he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the communist party ' s ruling pol ##it ##buro .
against this background , the new east german leader must move quickly to shore up his government ' s standing .
` ` he does n ' t have any honeymoon period , ' ' says a western diplomat based in east berlin .
` ` but if he ' s sharp and quick , he has a chance . ' '
the diplomat adds that mr . k ##ren ##z has several things going for him .
the east german economy is strong compared with other east bloc nations .
for average east germans , mr . k ##ren ##z remains a puzzle .
` ` either way , i have a problem with how quickly he ' s changed . ' '

television last week carried a new report on east berlin ' s main wall ##paper factory and the need to boost production .
his point was there is no reason for east germany to copy soviet - style changes .
the list of laboratories claiming to be producing in ##ex ##pl ##ica ##ble amounts of heat from ` ` cold fusion ' ' experiments is slowly growing .
but the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fu ##sing of hydrogen atoms .
the meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research .
but some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the department of energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience .
the committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether doe should support cold fusion research .
or ##dina ##rily the electro ##lysis , or breakup , of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy .
but mess ##rs . fl ##eis ##chman ##n and po ##ns said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat .
one of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by richard a . or ##iani , professor of chemical engineering at the university of minnesota .
mr . or ##iani said his skepticism of the utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results .
but he then borrowed a pal ##lad ##ium rod from chemist ##s at texas a & m who said they were getting excess heat .
` ` the results were fascinating , ' ' he said .
on the fourth ` ` run ' ' with the borrowed rod , the experiment began producing excess heat .
the experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument .
when it was restarted , heat output ` ` really took off ' ' and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down , he said .
typical of other experiments , mr . or ##iani said his experiment was ` ` very erratic . ' '
the excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electro ##lysis of water .
` ` there is a reality to the excess energy , ' ' he said .
other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time .
one chemist privately suggested this hinted that some ` ` an ##oma ##lous ' ' chemical reactions might be producing the heat .
one reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually met ##ic ##ulous measurements .
typically , the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenth ##s of a watt .
one exception is a continuing experiment at stanford university where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electro ##ly ##tic cells .
one of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist john bo ##ck ##ris of texas a & m university .
mr . bo ##ck ##ris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tri ##tium forming in the heavy water .
increasingly careful attempts to measure neutron ##s , which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions , continue to be negative .
mess ##rs . fl ##eis ##chman ##n and po ##ns initially reported indirect evidence of neutron ##s being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable .
in subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutron ##s but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time .
they concluded the indications of neutron ##s stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .
dow jones & co . announced wall street journal advertising rates for 1990 .
the rates , which take effect jan . 2 , include a 4 % increase for national edition advertising .
the journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discount ##s .
the increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6 . 5 % increase in 1989 .
` ` news ##print and postage prices this year have not gone up , ' ' said peter r . kan ##n , president of dow jones .
` ` we have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs .
fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies with our customers . ' '
rates for the wall street journal reports will remain unchanged .
a one - time non ##con ##tra ##ct full - page advertisement in the wall street journal national edition will cost $ 99 , 385 .
advertising rates for the wall street journal \ / europe , published in brussels and printed in the netherlands and switzerland , will increase 9 % .
rates for the asian wall street journal , published and printed in hong kong and also printed in singapore and tokyo , will rise 8 % .
rates for the asian wall street journal weekly , published in new york for north american readers , will rise 6 % .
dow jones also publishes barron ' s magazine , other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services .
it owns 67 % of tel ##erate inc . , a leading supplier of computer ##ized financial information on global markets .
sales fell 2 . 5 % to $ 1 . 54 billion from $ 1 . 58 billion .
sales were $ 4 . 66 billion , up 1 . 3 % from $ 4 . 6 billion .
jerry junk ##ins , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said slug ##gis ##h consumer - electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductor ##s .
that , coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor - de ##pre ##ciation expense , contributed to the decline in sales and profit .
however , the quarter results included $ 28 million in royalty income from patent licenses , up from $ 21 million in the year - earlier period .
the nine months include $ 125 million of royalty income , up from $ 98 million last year .
mr . junk ##ins was n ' t optimistic about the short - term outlook , hint ##ing that further workforce reductions may be needed .
further , he said , an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the information technology group is expected to affect fourth - quarter results by an undisclosed amount .
western new mexico telephone , silver city , had net income of $ 1 . 9 million on revenue of about $ 10 million last year .
it is an independent phone company with a service area of 15 , 000 square miles in southwest new mexico .
it is also a partner in the wire ##line cellular franchise covering most of western new mexico .
the transaction represents lynch ' s entry into the telephone business .
nelson bunker hunt ' s attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal .
photographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negative ##s and processing solutions .
meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes .
japanese and u . s . photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and x - rays that do n ' t require silver , dealers say .
silver ' s history of vol ##ati ##lity is also disco ##ura ##ging investors , dealers say .
silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum .
some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are lang ##uis ##hing at levels last seen in the mid - 1970s .
a further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the u . s . , he says .
scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are disco ##ura ##ging exports from india and the soviet union .
silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations peru and mexico , mr . dem ##ler says .
meanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row , he says .
despite intermittent rallies in the past few years , improvements in the supply - demand balance have n ' t managed to push silver prices into a higher range .
` ` silver production is also in an in ##ex ##ora ##ble upward trend , ' ' ms . o ' connell says .
yet if gold prices improve , silver prices could rally sharply , he says .
however , dealers caution that any increase would be $ 1 to $ 2 at most .
most analysts had expected the government to report a 4 % decline .
feed ##lot ##s fat ##ten young cattle for slaughter , so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef .
the government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feed ##lot ##s during the quarter dropped 5 % compared with the year - earlier quarter .
many industry analysts had been projecting a 3 % decline in placement ##s for the quarter .
in the 1988 quarter , many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feed ##lot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranch ##es .
the number of cattle moving onto feed ##lot ##s in the recent quarter was also lower because fat ##ten ##ing cattle is less profitable .
a shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feed ##lot operators to buy .
most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract ' s going off the board .
for example , copper for december delivery settled 4 . 5 cents lower at $ 1 . 234 ##5 a pound .
pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long - term strikes .
the mine is expected to return to production in about a week .
on friday , selling dominated the afternoon ` ` curb ' ' session in london , which takes place at noon ed ##t .
the premium of cash copper to the three - month forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand for cash copper .
long - term support for the december contract was believed to be at $ 1 . 25 a pound .
a technical analyst said there were a number of stop - loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract ' s price fell below it .
that brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading .
another analyst said he expected l ##me inventor ##ies to be down by about 15 , 000 tons when the weekly report is issued .
mr . sava ##iko said he sees a possibility of the december contract dropping to $ 1 . 05 a pound .
called task broker , the program acts something like an auction ##eer among a group of computers wired together .
if a machine has a big computing task , task broker asks other computers in the network for ` ` bids ' ' on the job .
it then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine .
in today ' s computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are over ##ta ##xed .
with the he ##wl ##ett - packard program , he said , ` ` you get more bang for the buck you ' ve spent on computers . ' '
the program , which will be shipped in january 1990 , runs on the unix operating system .
he ##wl ##ett - packard will charge $ 5 , 000 for a license covering 10 users .
he ##wl ##ett - packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on sun micro ##systems inc . and digital equipment corp . machines .
the task broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network .
but programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system .
price wars between the fast - food giants are starting to cl ##ob ##ber the fast - food little guys : the franchise ##es .
though char ##ism ##a ' s sales are up slightly this year , mr . hart ##y says profits will be flat or lower .
the situation was further aggravated early this month , when mcdonald ' s set plans to heat up the discount ##ing by offering coup ##ons .
it also decided to go national with pizza , which it has been test - marketing .
now , two - for - one deals on pizza are common ; so are 99 - cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high .
the discount ##ing , say fast - food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n ' t seen before .
the result is that some franchise ##es are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less .
` ` it ' s almost as if you ' re doing extra work to give away the food , ' ' he says .
` ` the industry is over ##bu ##il ##t , ' ' he says .
` ` fast - food franchise ##rs have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available . ' '
simply put , there is n ' t enough business for every store to grow .
` ` mcdonald ' s has also been running negative all year , ' ' the analyst says .
spoke ##sm ##en for wendy ' s and mcdonald ' s criticized mr . ro ##hs ' s calculations .
he adds that short - term comparisons ` ` can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year . ' '
profits of franchise ##es have n ' t been higher since the mid - 1970s , he adds .
but mr . greenberg ' s sang ##uin ##e outlook is n ' t matched by many fast - food industry observers .
smaller chains and single - store operators will be the first to fail , many in the industry predict .
big franchise groups ` ` can ride out the storm a lot longer , ' ' says mr . hart ##y , the burger king operator in new york .
the prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchise ##rs and their franchise ##es .
franchise ##es ca n ' t be forced to go along with a franchise ##r ' s discount ##ing .
he says courts have held that anti ##trust considerations are out ##weig ##hed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from dec ##eptive marketing .
in any case , many franchise ##es , in order to stay on good terms with franchise ##rs , routinely go along with promotions .
says mr . ri ##ese of national restaurants : ` ` if you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .
companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .

and you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an irs audit .
reggie jackson , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them .
dealers say the bud ##ding trade in mr . jackson ' s canceled checks is unusual .
an initial batch of mr . jackson ' s checks was on sale at a baseball - card show held in san francisco over labor day weekend .
mr . jackson showed up at the affair to sign auto ##graphs for a fee as well .
for years , the canceled checks of a small number of well - known baseball players have been bought and sold .
however , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way .
` ` who knows how much they ' ll be worth 100 years from now ? ' '
and mr . small ##ing does n ' t believe they ' re worth all that much now .
` ` i do n ' t think the checks are worth $ 15 api ##ece , ' ' he says .
why mr . jackson , who could n ' t be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n ' t clear .
he probably has n ' t done it for the cash .
and mr . jackson probably has opened new checking accounts , too .
` ` i assume those accounts are closed , ' ' says mr . small ##ing , referring to the accounts of the canceled checks .
` ` i do n ' t think he ' d want to give out his current account numbers .
terms were n ' t disclosed for the plant , which will have annual capacity of 600 , 000 tons .
the move by the nation ' s largest steel ##maker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies .
bethlehem steel corp . , lt ##v corp . and arm ##co inc . all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion - resistant steel .
the surge in production , analysts say , raises questions about capacity out ##pac ##ing demand .
` ` there ' s too much capacity , ' ' contend ##ed charles bradford , an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets .
` ` i do n ' t think there ' s anyone not building one . ' '
that trend could increase demand for hot - dipped gal ##vani ##zed sheet .
moreover , it will boost by 50 % us ##x ' s current hot - dipped capacity of 1 , 275 , 000 tons .
steel ##makers have also been adding capacity of so - called electro ##gal ##vani ##zed steel , which is another way to make coated corrosion - resistant steel .
one of the advantages of the hot - dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly .
once you make up your mind about an investment , the rest is easy , right ?
you just call your broker and say ` ` buy ' ' or ` ` sell . ' '
so here ' s a run ##down of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges .
two things to keep in mind : not all exchanges accept every type of order .
and even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a broker ##age firm can refuse to enter it for a customer .
with a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell ` ` at the market . ' '
it ' s like saying , ` ` get me in now ' ' or ` ` get me out now . ' '
profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the con ##sp ##iring broker ##s .
limit order : limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment .
investors do this by specify ##ing a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it .
suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 .
a limit order to sell could be entered at that price .
one risk : investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls .
stop order : stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level .
once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get .
stop orders are sometimes called ` ` stop - loss ' ' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses .
in contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .
the crash in october 1987 and last friday ' s sell - off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n ' t do .
stop - limit order : stop - limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order .
if it ca n ' t be made at that price , it does n ' t get filled .
but if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price .
market - if - touched order : market - if - touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached .
as soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price .
fill - or - kill order : the fill - or - kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades .
it ins ##truct ##s a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better .
but if the investment ca n ' t be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled .
` ` i like to use them to feel out the market , ' ' he says .
not - held order : this is another timing order .
not - held orders , which are also known as ` ` disregard the tape ' ' orders , are always done at the customer ' s risk .
in a fast - moving market , it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security .
` ` on the close ' ' can be added to many types of orders .
` ` stop - close - only orders ' ' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading .
most broker ##s assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise .
they found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel .
it is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed .
investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are , usually , stuck with the consequences .
mr . ang ##rist writes on the options and commodities markets for the wall street journal .
in si ##zing up the risks of stock - market investments , there ' s probably no starting place better than ` ` beta . ' '
but investors better not ignore its limitations , either .
beta is a handy gauge that measures the vol ##ati ##lity of a stock or stock mutual fund .
for any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steep ##ly that particular issue might rise or fall .
beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret .
the beta of the broad market , typically defined as the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index , is always 1 . 0 .
so a stock with a beta of 0 . 5 is half as volatile , one at 1 . 5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on .
cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low beta ##s .
go with high - beta stocks to get the biggest pay ##off from a bet on a bull market .
remember , though , that beta also has important limitations .
` ` there is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n ' t tell you the magnitude of that . ' '
in particular , beta does n ' t measure the company - and industry - specific risk associated with an individual stock .
beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer .
` ` in reality it ' s very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements .
ready to review the risk ##iness of your investment portfolio ?
when you think of the words ` ` risk ' ' and ` ` investment , ' ' what ' s the specific per ##il that comes to mind ?
risk wears many disguise ##s , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distress ##ingly high in other , less obvious kinds .
u . s . treasury bonds , for example , are super ##sa ##fe when it comes to returning money at maturity .
but their value as investments can be dec ##imated by inflation , which er ##odes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed - dollar interest payments .
when financial professionals measure risk mathematical ##ly , they usually focus on the vol ##ati ##lity of short - term returns .
stocks are much risk ##ier than treasury bills , for example , because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider .
that is usually measured by the standard deviation , or diver ##gence , of annual results from the average return over time .
for instance , some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash ; last friday ' s de ##ba ##cle only reinforced those feelings .
but the stock market , despite some stomach - churning declines , has far out ##per ##formed other securities over extended periods .
by retreating to the apparent security of , say , money - market funds , investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement .
as a result , financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the risk ##iness of clients ' portfolio ##s .
they try to figure out the long - term results the person needs to meet major goals .
and they eye ##ball types of risk that are not easily quan ##ti ##fied .
for instance , the ins ##ured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple ' s portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repay ##ment risk .
but they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest - rate risk .
the younger couple ' s stock ##holding ##s involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue .
- l ##rb - here ' s how to interpret a standard deviation figure : take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it .
then take the expected return and sub ##tra ##ct one standard deviation .
in two of three years , the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate .
then add and sub ##tra ##ct two standard deviation ##s to get a wider range .
there ' s a 95 % probability any year ' s result will fall in the range . - rr ##b -
` ` but they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future . ' '
ms . slater reports on personal finance from the wall street journal ' s new york bureau .
but while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there ' s no guarantee that the past will repeat itself .
for instance , some analysts believe bond returns and vol ##ati ##lity have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market .
and returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long - term past .

mr . schwartz is a business executive and writer in new york .
when james schwartz was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice .
he tried management consulting , traded in turquoise for a while , and even managed professional wrestlers .
now he has settled into a career that fits the bill - - financial planning .
but in this case the needle has a very sharp point .
planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars , but in effect they operate in the dark .
all anyone need do is hang up a shin ##gle and start planning .
alarmed , state and federal authorities are trying to devi ##se ways to ce ##rti ##fy and regulate planners .

his group , like others , wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners .
surveying all this , some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all .
the bad news , however , has n ' t been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning .
an estimated 10 million americans are now using financial planners , and the pool of capital they influence is enormous .
the sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate .
currently , a registered investment adviser can expect an sec audit only once every 12 years .
a lot of bad things can happen in 12 years .

the states have their own ideas about regulation and certification .
nasa ##a , the organization of state securities regulators , is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states .
it requires financial planners to register with states , pass compete ##ncy tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest .
nasa ##a estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products they recommend .
the issue : is the planner putting his clients into the best investments , or the ones that garner the biggest commissions ?
those investments paid big commissions to first meridian , payments investors were never told about , the attorney general alleged .
investors were further assured that only those with a mini ##mun net worth would be accepted .
first meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrong ##do ##ing , according to a spoke ##sw ##oman for the attorney general .

` ` he said he wanted to show the color of his money , ' ' recalls mr . die ##bel .
bank officials , however , showed him the door , and the sale never came off .
according to the suit , mr . peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment .
mr . peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits , saying he prefers to save such responses for court .
but he does say that all of his activities have been ` ` entirely proper . ' '
on the suit by the limited partners , he says he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs .
the suit , he adds , ` ` is almost in the nature of a ve ##nde ##tta by a handful of di ##sg ##run ##tled people . ' '

because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted , nobody really knows how much money bog ##us tel ##ema ##rke ##ting operators really harvest .
` ` i ' ve heard that there is $ 40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year , ' ' mr . mcc ##lellan ##d says .
` ` if that ' s true , orange county has to be at least 10 % of that . ' '
in fact , sophisticated big - bucks boiler - room sc ##ams are known generic ##ally among law - enforcement types as ` ` newport beach ' ' operations .
newport beach tel ##ema ##rke ##ters concentrate on precious metals and oil - leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot .
the investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals .
thus falsely reassured , investors sent $ 11 . 4 million to the newport beach company , most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses , the indictment charges .
` ` there were some business deals that went bad , ' ' mr . jones says , ` ` but no intent to def ##ra ##ud . ' '
newport beach operations differ from the hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars .
traditionally , boiler rooms operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customers ever visit their offices .
indeed , the name derives from the tendency among tel ##ema ##rke ##ting sc ##am ##mers to rent cheap basement space , near the boiler room .
the newport beach operators also tend to ind ##ul ##ge themselves privately .
all this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is un ##ner ##ving to the city ' s legitimate business element .
' ' - l ##rb - investigators stress that building owners are victims , too , since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent . - rr ##b -

you went to college and thought you got an education .

some investment advisers are suggesting , in effect , a bet on a start - up investment pool - - maybe even on margin .
others prefer deep - discount zero - coup ##on bonds .
still others say , why not take a chance on a high - oct ##ane growth fund ?
in other words , a little vol ##ati ##lity never hurt .
it never hurt anyone , that is , unless the growth funds do n ' t grow when you need them to .
or the zero - coup ##on bonds turn out not to have been discount ##ed deeply enough to pay your kid ' s tuition .
that ' s the dilemma for today ' s parent .
although many experts are advising risk , no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n ' t pay off .

he takes issue with projections that do n ' t factor in students ' own contribution , which reduces most parents ' burden substantially .
still , he says , ` ` it ' s no bad thing ' ' if all the marketing pro ##ds people into putting aside a little more .
parents , he says , should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford .
half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal , he adds .
that way , parents will reduce borrowing ##s and out ##lay ##s from current income when the time comes to pay tuition .
he favors either an all - stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds .
in their anxiety , however , parents and other student benefactor ##s are flock ##ing to new schemes .
and they have bought about $ 500 million in prep ##aid - tuition plans , offered in michigan , florida and wyoming .
in june , virginia sold bonds for $ 268 . 98 that will pay $ 1 , 000 in 2009 .
their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up .
most other bonds , however , would probably not have fare ##d much better .
the prep ##aid plans may be a good bet , provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure .
two private groups are seeking securities and exchange commission approval for plans that could be more broadly transfer ##able .
mr . anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan .
the issue here may be the sound ##ness of the guarantee .
prep ##ay ##ments , much like mutual - fund purchases , are poole ##d for investment .
sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns .
but buyers are essentially betting on a start - up investment fund with no track record - - and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so .
one problem is that the internal revenue service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxa ##ble .
the colleges , as educational institutions , had hoped that would n ' t be the case .
but sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market .
and they ' re leaning more toward fixed income , whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases .
` ` i ' m not sure they ' re going to make it work , ' ' says mr . anderson .
what happens if the sponsors do n ' t have the cash to pay the tuition ##s ?

the plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria .
but that does n ' t mean ` ` half of the students attending berkeley ' ' will be admitted this way .
the plan is talking about applicants admitted , not students who enroll .
this category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of regis ##tra ##nts .
the plan thus will decrease by 22 % , for a net loss of 10 % , the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria .
but the new category does not replace or reduce berkeley ' s broad racial preferences .
the role of academic criteria in choosing berkeley ' s freshmen can only decline as a result .

fox hunting has been defined as the un ##sp ##eak ##able in pursuit of the in ##ed ##ible , but at least it ' s exercise .
most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither , dr ##ab duties rather than pleasures .
like trying to buy life insurance , for instance , an endeavor notably lacking in dash .
call it the un ##in ##formed tr ##ud ##ging after the inc ##omp ##re ##hen ##sible .
but sooner or later , most of us have to think about life insurance , just as we often have to think about having root - canal work .
i ' m 33 , married , no children , and employed in writing stories like this one .
in times past , life - insurance sales ##men targeted heads of household , meaning men , but ours is a two - income family and accustomed to it .
if all you want is death - benefit coverage , pure insurance - - a term policy - - gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits .
it ' s much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age .
but ` ` term ' ' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it ex ##pire ##s .
even if you ' re healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you ' re that much older .
so term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks .
upon examination , however , i wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .
first , if i canceled , i ' d have no more insurance , a not insignificant consideration .
which goes to show that the first law applies in insurance as in anything else : there is no free lunch , there is only marketing .
this is worth remembering when ins ##urer ##s and their sales ##men try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that ama ##sse ##s cash value .
the implication is that your permanent - insurance policy is really some kind of cd or mutual - fund account with an added feature .
that ' s because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package .
so view permanent insurance for what it is - - a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .
the simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy .
congress closed this loop ##hole last year , or thought it did .
but the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax - free is very small .
i ' m not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately , so i look into the broad category called universal life .
hugely popular , it is far more flexible than straight whole life .
projecting the latter over several decades , i find my cash build ##up is impressive - - but can any high interest rate pre ##va ##il for that long ?
also , some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that i will get some sort of divide ##nd bonus after the 10th year .
there are seemingly endless twists to universal life , and it pays to ask questions about all of them .
if interest rates plunge , the ins ##urer may be knocking on my door , asking for steep ##er premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection .
i do n ' t like the sound of that .
and the feature is so new , he adds , that no ins ##urer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments .
so - called living - benefits provisions also merit a close inspection .
also , financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempt ##ing these advance payments from taxes .
i ' m more favorably impressed by ` ` no - load life , ' ' even though it turns out to be low - load life .
after one year i could walk away from the am ##eri ##tas policy with $ 79 ##2 , but id get only $ 14 from the e ##quitable .
the difference is mag ##nified by time , too .
i ' m thinking about using the $ 87 ##1 annual premium to finance a trip to paris first .
a person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there - - and shop for something more exciting while she ' s doing it .
mr . ca ##wt ##horn said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of ` ` somewhat less than 10 % . ' '
through the first six months of 1989 , sales had grown about 12 % from the year - earlier period .
growth of 10 % would make sales for the latest quarter $ 269 million , compared with $ 244 . 6 million a year ago .
mr . ca ##wt ##horn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two ro ##rer drugs .
as ##ilo ##ne , an ant ##ac ##id , was sold to boots plc , london .
th ##rom ##bina ##r , a drug used to stan ##ch bleeding , was sold to jones medical industries inc . , st . louis .
as the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was ` ` significantly ' ' below the year - earlier level , mr . ca ##wt ##horn said .
ro ##rer in july had projected lower third - quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989 .
he said the company is still looking for ` ` a strong fourth quarter in all areas - - sales , operating income and net income . ' '

if you think you have stress - related problems on the job , there ' s good news and bad news .
you ' re probably right , and you are n ' t alone .
the study surveyed a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies .

it is n ' t true that a 90 - year old clergyman on a mission of mercy to a disaster area on christmas day can fly free .
but his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in america .
in recent years , carriers have become much more pick ##y about who can fly on the cheap .
but there still are a few ways today ' s traveler can qualify under the airline ' s many restrictions .
one of the best deals , though , may mean skipping christmas dinner with the relatives .
in recent years , the airlines had waited until the last moment to court christmas season vacation ##ers with bargain fares .
that approach flopped : last christmas day , a usa ##ir group inc . dc - 9 jet ##liner flew about seven passengers from chicago to pittsburgh .

when his seventh avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago , jack pu ##rn ##ick had 25 workers and a large factory .
now his half - dozen employees work in an eighth - floor shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room .
the difference lies in how the two entrepreneur ##ial fur ##rier ##s reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years .
one stuck to old - line business traditions , while the other embraced the change .
` ` the small , good fur salon is not what it used to be , ' ' says mr . pu ##rn ##ick , 75 years old .
` ` we make the finest product in the world , and the americans are being kicked around . ' '
mr . rosen , though , believes imports have rein ##vi ##gor ##ated the industry in which he has worked for most of his 57 years .
` ` you ' ve got some minds here that wo n ' t think progressively , ' ' he says .
the new market helped boost u . s . fur sales to about $ 1 . 8 billion a year now , triple the level in the late 1970s .
it also opened the door to fur ##s made in south korea , china , hong kong and other countries .
mr . pu ##rn ##ick and other old - line fur ##rier ##s call many of the the imports un ##sty ##lish and poorly made .
high - end u . s . fur ##rier ##s say these imports have n ' t squeezed them .
yet mr . rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage .
in 1982 , he started a factory in greece .
two years later , he opened one in west germany .
he also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur , and he decided to follow suit .
but six years ago he also began import ##ing from the far east .
inspired by imports , mr . rosen now makes fur mu ##ffs , hats and fling ##s .
this year he produced a men ' s line and offers dyed fur ##s in red , cherry red , violet , royal blue and forest green .
he has leather jackets from turkey that are lined with eel skin and topped off with ra ##cco ##on - skin collar ##s .
from asia , he has min ##k jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored fur ##s .
next he will be testing pictured embroidery - l ##rb - called ka ##leg ##a - rr ##b - made in the far east .
he plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of min ##k coats and jackets .
besides adding to sales , leather ##s also attract retailers who may buy fur ##s later , he adds .
other fur ##rier ##s have also benefited from leather ##s .
he says it accounts for 25 % of total sales .
this year he bought two stores , one in brooklyn and one in queens .
other fur ##rier ##s have also placed more weight on retail ##ing .
golden feldman fur ##s inc . began retail ##ing aggressively eight years ago , and now retail sales account for about 20 % of gross income .
in other moves , mr . rosen says he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers .
since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his fur ##s to the front door of retailers as far away as the midwest .
small retailers who ca n ' t afford to travel to his new york show ##room have become fair game .
such moves have helped mr . rosen weather the industry slump of recent years .
the industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 , but since 1986 sales have lang ##uis ##hed at their $ 1 . 8 billion peak .
large fur ##rier ##s such as anton ##ovich inc . , fur vault inc . and evans inc . all reported losses in their latest fiscal years .

two weeks after boost ##ing base rates to 15 % , he pledged that ` ` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . ' '
mr . lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
a sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued .
he said he monitors the money - supply figures , but does n ' t give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested .
mr . lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on britain ' s financial system .
despite the increase , the british currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week .

health - care companies should get health ##ier in the third quarter .
to offset slug ##gis ##h sales growth , companies have been cutting staff , mostly through at ##tri ##tion , and slowing the growth in research and development spending .
sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers , such as hospitals , to hold down prices .
suppliers were also hurt by the stronger u . s . dollar , which makes sales abroad more difficult .

sales for the deer ##field , ill . , company rose 5 . 8 % to $ 1 . 81 billion from $ 1 . 71 billion .
but not every company expects to report increased earnings .
sales fell 1 . 2 % to $ 190 . 1 million from $ 192 . 5 million .
in 1988 , the company earned $ 1 . 38 a share .
the food and drug administration had raised questions about the device ' s design .
some analysts add that third - party pressures to reduce health costs will continue to bed ##ev ##il companies ' bottom lines .
` ` as that wan ##es , you ' re going to see the stocks probably wan ##e as well , ' ' he says .
hospitals companies , meanwhile , are reporting improved earnings .
analysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefit ##ing from several trends .
most important , hospital admission rates are stab ##ili ##zing after several years of decline .
moreover , companies have sold off many of their smaller , less - profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructuring ##s .
human ##a ' s revenues , for example , are being boosted by large increases in enrollment ##s in the company ' s health maintenance organizations .
says todd richter , an analyst with dean wit ##ter reynolds : ` ` the shake ##out in the publicly traded companies is over .
these figures are n ' t seasonal ##ly adjusted .
the figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking ny ##ne ##x corp . workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits , the official said .
revenue rose 6 . 4 % to $ 3 . 13 billion from $ 2 . 94 billion .
digital said a shift in its product mix toward low - end products and strong growth in works ##tation sales yielded lower gross margins .
a spokesman also said margins for the company ' s service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector .
the lack of a strong product at the high end of digital ' s line was a significant drag on sales .
digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first main ##frame - class computers next tuesday .
the new line is aimed directly at international business machines corp .

dec shares rose $ 1 . 375 to $ 89 . 75 api ##ece in consolidated new york stock exchange trading yesterday .
some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead .
` ` i think the next few quarters will be difficult , ' ' said steven mil ##uno ##vich of first boston .
` ` margins will remain under pressure , and when the new main ##frame does ship , i ' m not sure it will be a big winner .
one tr ##ou ##bling aspect of dec ' s results , analysts said , was its performance in europe .
dec said its overseas business , which now accounts for more than half of sales , improved in the quarter .
` ` that was a disappointment ' ' and a sign of overall computer - market softness in europe , mr . stevens said .
` ` the bottom line is that it ' s more hand to mouth than it has been before , ' ' he said .
he said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in december , with all of the more sophisticated versions out by june .

in the year - earlier period , col ##gate posted net income of $ 60 . 2 million , or 88 cents a share .
last year ' s results included earnings from discontinued operations of $ 13 . 1 million , or 19 cents a share .
reuben mark , chairman and chief executive officer of col ##gate , said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in latin america , the far east and europe .
` ` improving profit ##ability of u . s . operations is an extremely high priority in the company . ' '
col ##gate ' s results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecast ##s .
the scope of the improvement in the u . s . business caught some analysts by surprise .
the company ' s domestic business , especially its household products division , has performed poorly for years .
analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales .
for the nine months , net increased 14 % to $ 217 . 5 million , or $ 3 . 09 a share .
sales rose 7 % to $ 3 . 8 billion .
the company earned $ 191 . 1 million , or $ 2 . 79 a share , in the year - earlier period .
col ##gate ' s 1988 net income included $ 40 . 1 million , or 59 cents a share , from discontinued operations .
col ##gate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year .
the products - - seal ##ants and bonding materials used by dentist ##s - - all contain flu ##ori ##de that is released over time .
the move is part of a drive to increase col ##gate ' s business with dentist ##s , a company spoke ##sw ##oman said .
terms of the agreement were n ' t given .
the bon ##anza franchise system , which generates about $ 600 million in sales annually , represented substantially all of the partnership ' s assets .
the company said it believes the suit is without merit .
at & t also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter .
at & t said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34 , 000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments .
at & t said third - quarter net income grew , despite stiff competition in all of the company ' s markets .
revenue edged up to $ 8 . 9 billion from $ 8 . 81 billion .
sales of long - distance services , an extremely competitive market , rose 6 . 4 % .
but the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rental ##s and price cuts on some products .
an at & t spoke ##sw ##oman said the company would likely replace about one - third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees .
analysts hailed the sweet ##ened pension package , which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months .
but other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost - cutting move wo n ' t result in even greater earnings growth .
at & t said the special retirement option will increase fourth - quarter expenses .
but the company said the amount ca n ' t be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire .
revenue gained 3 . 1 % to $ 26 . 81 billion from $ 26 billion .
in composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange , at & t shares closed at $ 43 . 375 , up 87 . 5 cents .
when it comes to buying and selling shares , west ##ridge capital management inc . takes a back seat to no one .
every dollar ' s worth of stock in the los angeles money manager ' s portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year , the firm estimates .
that makes it the most active trader among all the nation ' s investment advisers , according to securities and exchange commission filing ##s .
west ##ridge capital is an index fund - - the type of st ##oli ##d long - term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average .
west ##ridge capital ' s fr ##ene ##tic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of index ##ing .
institutional investors have poured $ 210 billion into stock and bond index ##ing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns .
and the fees investors pay for index ##ing run a few penn ##ies for each $ 100 of assets - - a fraction of the cost of active managers .
that ' s because computers do most of the work , and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs .
but today , index ##ing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one .
` ` now the interest is in what else can i do with that money . ' '
plain - vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some cases are just that .
to land customers for their well - paying stock cu ##sto ##dial business , big banks sometimes will throw in basic index ##ing services for free .
` ` it ' s like getting a free toast ##er when you open an account , ' ' says axe core ' s mr . lynn .
as a result , index ##ers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money .
and many have been successful , as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper - trader west ##ridge capital .
strategies vary for west ##ridge capital , which has $ 300 million under management .
mr . card ##er also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines .
and in some months , he buys stock - index futures and not stocks at all .
` ` by their nature , our trades are very short - term and are going to create high turnover , ' ' mr . card ##er adds .
` ` the more turnover , the better for our clients . ' '
big index ##er bankers trust co . also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund ' s returns .
` ` you ' re buying the s & p , and you always want to hold the cheap ##est form of it , ' ' he says .
but some index ##ers make little or no use of futures , saying that these instruments present added risks for investors .
an added feature is that the slight ##y improved return would be guaranteed by pr ##ude ##ntial .
there are many other strategies to bo ##lster the returns of index funds .
these guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains .
here a fund may promise to pay back , say , $ 95 of every $ 100 invested for a year , even if the market goes much lower .
the fund could invest $ 87 for one year in treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed $ 95 .
that leaves $ 13 , which could be used to buy s & p 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the s & p index .
say a big investor is interested in growth stocks .
` ` we see a lot of interest in those kind of things , ' ' says frank sale ##rno , a vice president of bankers trust .
` ` people comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies . ' '
instead of replica ##ting the s & p 500 or some other index exactly , some stocks are over ##weight ##ed or under ##weight ##ed in the portfolio .
index ##es can be constructed to serve social goals , such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in south africa .
other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment .
am ##ex short interest climbed 3 % to 53 , 49 ##6 , 66 ##5 shares from 51 , 911 , 56 ##6 shares .
am ##ex short interest has been heading upward since mid - december , with increases in each month since then except at mid - july .
short interest is the number of shares that have n ' t yet been purchased for return to lend ##ers .
flu ##ct ##uation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by ar ##bit ##rag ##ing .
the figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock .
the level of negative sentiment measured by the big board short interest ratio slipped to 3 . 36 from last month ' s 3 . 38 .
the ratio is the number of trading days , at the exchange ' s average trading volume , that would be required to convert the total short interest position .
some analysts suggest , however , that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions .
var ##ity corp . led the big board list of largest short volumes with 12 , 82 ##2 , 56 ##3 shares .
short interest in international business machines corp . plunged to 1 , 425 , 03 ##5 shares from 2 , 38 ##7 , 226 shares a month earlier .
also closely watched is ex ##xon corp . , where short interest slid to 4 , 46 ##9 , 167 shares from 5 , 08 ##8 , 77 ##4 .
on a percentage basis , germany fund inc . led the gain ##ers , leaping to 67 , 97 ##2 shares from three shares .
trans ##cana ##da pipeline ##s ltd . led the percentage decline ##rs , dropping to 59 shares from 183 , 46 ##7 .
bo ##lar pharmaceutical co . posted the largest volume increase , 55 ##2 , 302 shares , to 2 , 157 , 65 ##6 .
the company is under an investigation concerning procedures to gain food and drug administration approval of generic drugs .
the company is facing a takeover proposal from the fin ##an ##cier sir james goldsmith .
first iberian fund led the percentage increases , rising to 73 , 100 shares from 184 .

for vietnamese , these are tricky , often treacherous , times .
after years of hesitation , economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986 , but ringing declaration ##s have yet to be translated into much action .
vietnam is finding that turning a st ##ag ##nant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n ' t come easy .
here is how three vietnamese are coping with change :
nguyen van chan is living proof that old ways die hard .
mr . chan used to be an odd ##ity in hanoi : a private entrepreneur .
his business success made him an official target in pre - reform days .
mr . chan , now 64 years old , invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste .
for his troubles , mr . chan was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974 .
though his operation was registered and used only scrap , he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials .
once he was held for three months without being charged .
things were supposed to change when vietnam ' s economic reforms gathered pace , and for awhile they did .
after years of experimenting , mr . chan produced a heavy - duty bicycle tire that out ##las ##ted its state - produced rival .
by 1982 , he was selling thousands of tires .
newspapers published articles about him , and he was hailed as ` ` the tire king . ' '
his efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition - - and attracted renewed attention from local authorities .
` ` that was the first time they lost and i won , ' ' he says .
he was further questioned to determine if he was ` ` a real working man or an exploit ##er . ' '
says mr . chan : ` ` when i showed it was from my own brain , they lost for the second time . ' '
but a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity , acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property .
warned he was to be jailed again , he fled to the countryside .
his family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated .
with only the clothes they were wearing , family members moved to a home owned by one of mr . chan ' s sons .
after six months on the run , mr . chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled .
he and his family kept afl ##oat by repairing bicycles , selling fruit and doing odd jobs .
mr . chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 - - and became a minor celebrity again - - when his story was published in a weekly newspaper .
in 1988 , 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family - run private enterprise , district authorities allowed mr . chan to resume work .
by late last year he was invited back as ` ` the tire king ' ' to display his products at a national exhibition .
national leaders stopped by his stand to com ##men ##d his achievements .
eighteen people pack the house ' s two rooms - - the chan ##s , four of their 10 children with spouse ##s , and eight of 22 grandchildren .
mr . chan talks optimistic ##ally of expanding , maybe even moving into the import - export field .
when district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing , they released only one of his machines .
they did n ' t return the rubber stocks that represent his capital .
nor did they return his house and contents , which he values at about $ 44 , 000 .
he wants to recover more than just his property , though .
` ` i want my dignity back , ' ' he says .
nguyen ngo ##c seemed an obvious choice when the vietnamese writers association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper , van ng ##he .
after the sixth congress , journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberal ##ization to probe previously taboo subjects .
appointed editor in chief in july 1987 , mr . ngo ##c rapidly turned the st ##aid van ng ##he into vietnam ' s hottest paper .
circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover vietnamese society and its ill ##s .
readers were electrified by the paper ' s au ##da ##city and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered .
one article recounted a decade - long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove , officially , he was alive .
another described how tax - collection officials in than ##h ho ##a province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers .
after months of internal rumbling ##s , mr . ngo ##c was fired last december .
his dismissal triggered a fur ##or among intellectuals that continues today .
for the leadership , that was too painful to bear . ' '
nguyen th ##i th ##i is vietnam ' s entrepreneur of the 1980s .
her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s .
mrs . th ##i did n ' t wait for the reforms to get her start .
she charged ahead of the government and the law to establish hoc ##him ##in ##h city food co . as the biggest rice dealer in the country .
her success , which included all ##ev ##iating an urban food shortage in the early 1980s , helped persuade hanoi to take the reform path .
her instincts were capitalist ##ic , despite her background .
the authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of ` ` the new way of thinking . ' '
foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her vietnam ' s richest woman .
` ` some people call me the communist billionaire , ' ' she has told visitors .
actually , 67 - year - old mrs . th ##i is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land .
she has indeed turned hoc ##him ##in ##h city food into a bud ##ding conglomerate , but the company itself remains state - owned .
she manages it with the title of general - director .
the company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses .
a subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network .
she expects both revenue and profit to gain this year .
she is almost cavalier about the possibility vietnam ' s reforms will create rivals on her home turf .
` ` i do n ' t mind the competition inside the country , ' ' she says .
` ` i am only afraid that with vietnam ' s poor - quality products we ca n ' t compete with neighboring countries .
the agency is preparing a report , to be issued today , on the earthquake ' s impact on the property - and casualty - insurance industry .
the only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by bay view federal savings & loan .
` ` losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of hurricane hugo , ' ' according to moody ' s .
your oct . 5 editorial ` ` a democratic tax cut ' ' contained an error .
in the third paragraph it referred to the senators seeking loop ##hole suggestions from lobby ##ists for various sectors of the economy .
among them , ` ` banana farmers . ' '
the only significant commercial banana farmers in the u . s . are in hawaii .
the hawaii banana industry association , to which nearly all of them belong , has no lobby ##ist .

in the year - ago period , the company earned $ 12 . 9 million , or 45 cents a share , on sales of $ 247 million .
sales for the just - ended period fell to about $ 225 million , the maker of computer parts said .
nonetheless , chairman roger w . johnson said he expects the company to be profitable in the current quarter .
` ` we are positioned to come through , ' ' he said , noting that the company ' s back ##log was up from the previous quarter .
although the plant itself was n ' t damaged , mr . johnson said millions of dollars in first - quarter revenue were lost .
the revenue will be regained in the current period , he added .
western digital does n ' t make the monitors .
an accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further damp ##ened res ##eller purchases of western digital ' s equipment .
` ` the other areas of the business - - storage and micro ##com ##put ##ers - - were very good , ' ' mr . johnson said .
still , mr . johnson said , ` ` our stock is gross ##ly under ##val ##ue ##d . ' '
graphics , communications and peripheral control chips were combined because , increasingly , multiple functions are being governed by a single chip .
storage , which includes computer controllers and 3 . 5 - inch disk drives , represents nearly two - thirds of the company ' s business .
as smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry , he said , western digital is strengthening development of laptop parts .
the plan will help the company in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with at & t .
about half of western digital ' s business is overseas , and mr . johnson expects that proportion to continue .
plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company , he said , particularly since western digital already manufactures there .
capital ##izing on that presence , western digital is launching a major effort to develop the embryo ##nic res ##eller market in europe .
until now , bn ##l ' s top managers and its directors have been appointed by a treasury decree .
but under the bank ' s proposed statutes , an assembly of shareholders must approve board members .
the bank ' s chairman and director general , who also sit on the board , still would be appointed by the treasury .
in a related move , the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank ' s new share ##holding structure .
bn ##l called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in december to vote on the proposals .
bn ##l has about 75 , 000 non ##vot ##ing shares that are listed on the milan stock exchange .
the government attributed the 0 . 3 % month - to - month rise in the index largely to higher energy prices .

revenue rose 24 % to $ 18 . 73 billion from $ 15 . 09 billion .
the aerospace and financial services concern said net income fell 5 % to $ 59 . 5 million from $ 62 . 8 million .
revenue of $ 1 . 73 billion was almost unchanged from last year ' s $ 1 . 72 billion .
per - share net of 66 cents , down from 72 cents , fell by more than overall net because of more shares outstanding .
net was aided by a lower income tax rate .
profit before taxes fell 17 % to $ 84 . 4 million from $ 101 . 4 million .
a year ago , net was $ 170 . 4 million , or $ 1 . 93 a share , on revenue of $ 5 . 3 billion .
but the plan only threatens to height ##en the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in september 1988 .
although the proposal must be approved by federal judge harold c . abrams ##on , w . herbert hunt has agreed to the peruvian mineral concern ' s proposal .
the tentative agreement between the irs and nelson bunker hunt is awaiting u . s . justice department approval .
in both cases , min ##pe ##co and manufacturers hanover have been fighting ferocious ##ly over their shares of the pie .
min ##pe ##co has threatened a ` ` volcano ' ' of litigation if the manufacturers hanover corp . unit attempts to force such a plan through the court .
` ` developments like this are hard to predict .
the five offices in erie and ottawa counties in northern ohio have total assets of about $ 88 million , ban ##c one said .
the purchase price will be established after ban ##c one has an opportunity to study the quality of the assets , ban ##c one said .
the merger is scheduled to take place in the 1990 first quarter .
the 47 ##3 funds tracked by the investment company institute , a washington - based trade group , rose to $ 356 . 1 billion , a record .
the $ 6 . 07 billion increase was the strongest weekly in ##flow since january 1988 .
the increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds .

the loan to um ##no was made in september 1983 .
heidi eh ##man might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young republicans .
white , 24 years old , a singer in her church choir , she symbol ##izes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to ronald reagan .
` ` i felt kind of safe , ' ' she says .
when the supreme court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion , ms . eh ##man opened her mind to democratic politics .
then a political novice , she stepped into a w ##hir ##l of ` ` pro - choice ' ' marches , house parties and fund - raise ##rs .
now she leads a grassroots abortion - rights campaign in pass ##ai ##c county for pro - choice democratic gubernatorial candidate james fl ##orio .
` ` people my age thought it was n ' t going to be an issue .
now it has - - especially for people my age . ' '
unless he closes the gap , republicans risk losing not only the governors ##hip but also the assembly next month .
going into the 1990s , the go ##p is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment democrats in the past .
before july , pro - choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion .

consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate 0 . 2 % in september , pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs , the labor department reported .
the report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than 190 points last friday .
the dow jones industrial average rallied on the news , closing 39 . 55 points higher at 268 ##3 . 20 .
bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall .
but many economists were not nearly as ju ##bil ##ant .
the climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months , they warned .
they also said the dollar is level ##ing off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods .
` ` it has been in what i would describe as a lu ##ll for the past several months . ' '
because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep 6 . 5 % last month , many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too .
as a result , many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did .
but retail energy prices declined 0 . 9 % in september .
still , some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind .
in both 1987 and 1988 , consumer prices rose 4 . 4 % .
mr . yard ##eni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices .
` ` back in 1987 - 88 , business was operating at fairly tight capacity , so businesses felt they could raise prices . ' '
now , he said , a slow ##down in economic activity has slack ##ened demand .
the mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the federal reserve will ease its interest - rate stance .
analysts say fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy .
transportation costs actually fell 0 . 5 % , and housing costs gained only 0 . 1 % .
apparel prices rocket ##ed up 1 . 7 % , but that was after three months of declines .
medical costs continued their steep ascent , rising 0 . 8 % after four consecutive months of 0 . 7 % increases .
car prices , another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month , still showed declines at the consumer level .
they dropped 0 . 4 % as dealers continued to offer re ##bate ##s to attract customers .
food prices rose 0 . 2 % for the second month in a row , far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year .
here are the seasonal ##ly adjusted changes in the components of the labor department ' s consumer price index for september .
after watching interest in the sport plum ##met for years , the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift .
across the country , resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical - music concerts to attract new customers .
some have built health spa ##s , business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski .
and this week , the industry ' s efforts will go national for the first time when it un ##ve ##ils a $ 7 million advertising campaign .
last season , lift - ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years .
by some estimates , nearly a fourth of all u . s . ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early ' 80s .
competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undo ##ing of many resorts .
but another big problem has been the aging of baby boom ##ers .
` ` ski school is great , ' ' cries out a to ##t , bundled in a snow ##suit as he pl ##ows down a bunny slope .
` ` you ' ll never know ' til you try , ' ' says a black skier .
ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touch ##y issue of safety .
but the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall .
` ` we wanted to show it ' s okay if you fall , ' ' says ms . dil ##lman ##n .
` ` most people think if you slip , you ' ll wind up in a body cast . ' '
many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business .
since 40 % of skier ##s are parents , many slopes are building nurse ##ries , expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids .
for $ 15 , they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment , with dinner , without mom and dad .
a few years ago , parents usually had to hire a sit ##ter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children .
to make skiing more convenient for time - strapped visitors , several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies .
in one phone call , ski buff ##s can make hotel and restaurant reservations , buy lift tickets , rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons .
and resorts are adding other amenities , such as price ##y restaurants , health spa ##s and vacation packages with a twist .
during winter carnival week , for example , visitors at sunday river in maine can take a hot - air balloon ride .
but some think that ' s being overly optimistic .
and most vacation ##ers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursion ##s .
but you knew that , did n ' t you ?
they are supposed to play the game next tuesday , in candles ##tick park here .
the theory is that the stadium , damaged by tuesday ' s earthquake , will be repaired by then , and that people will be able to get there .
like just about everything else , that remains to be seen .
but , at least , the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side .
as soon as the tremor passed , many people spontaneously arose and cheered , as though it had been a novel kind of pre - game show .
i thought and , i ' m sure , others did : ` ` you should n ' t have bothered . ' '
` ` it felt like i was on a station platform and a train went by , ' ' said one man , describing my own reaction .
a women said she saw the park ' s light standards sway .
a man said he saw the upper rim und ##ulate .
` ` i guess i thought , ` this is the world series and i ' m not go ##n na wi ##mp out ! ' ' '
here in the global village , though , folks do not stay un ##in ##formed for long .

within a few minutes , the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear .
its richter scale measurement was reported as 6 . 5 , then 6 . 9 , then 7 . 0 .
a section of the bay bridge had collapsed , as had a part of interstate highway 880 in oakland .
at 5 : 40 p . m . , scheduled game time having passed , some fans chant ##ed ` ` let ' s play ball . ' '
outside , i spotted two young men lu ##gging blocks of concrete .
` ` pieces of candles ##tick , ' ' they said .
the crowd remained good nature ##d , even be ##mus ##ed .
tv reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while , a few feet away , others watched the interviews on their portable tv ##s .
the traffic jam out of the park was monumental .
the six - mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours .
at my hotel , the west ##in , power was out , some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage , but little else .
the west ##in staff had , kindly , set out lighted candles in the ballroom , prepared a cold - cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets .
i fell asleep on the lobby floor , next to a man wearing a chicago cubs jacket .
i expected him to say , ` ` i told you so , ' ' but he already was s ##nor ##ing .
the journalist ##ic consensus was that the earthquake made the world series seem un ##im ##port ##ant .
my response was that sports rarely are important , only divert ##ing , and the quake merely highlighted that fact .
should the rest of the series be played at all ?
the quake and baseball were n ' t related , unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the 1972 olympics .
that heavily pol ##itic ##ized event learned nothing from the ho ##rri ##fying experience , and seems doomed to repeat it .
this has been widely dubbed the bart series , after the local subway line , and the bay bridge series .
flags fly at half - staff for the death of bart gia ##mat ##ti , the late baseball commissioner , and now the bay bridge lies in ruins .
it now will be played mostly for the record , and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible , without ` ` off ' ' days .
and i will never again complain about a rain ##out .
that was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover .
all $ 3 . 35 billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks .
but the ua ##l collapse , he says , ` ` may tell you it ' s not going to work that easily . ' '
but he warns that banks will have ` ` to have enough discipline ' ' not to make loans that are too risky .
` ` we did n ' t take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor , ' ' says a bank spokesman .
beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market , banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeover ##s .
a paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial , not political , draw ##backs of junk bonds .
but some observers believe paramount chairman martin davis wanted to avoid the possible tai ##nt of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for time .
in the end , mr . davis used junk bonds so that he could raise paramount ' s bid to $ 200 a share .
some monday - morning quarterback ##s said the initial lower bid , without junk bonds , was a factor in his losing the company .

inland steel industries inc . , battered by lower volume and higher costs , posted a 75 % drop in third - quarter earnings .
sales fell to $ 98 ##1 . 2 million from $ 1 . 02 billion .
the earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter ' s $ 45 . 3 million or $ 1 . 25 a share .
moreover , the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about $ 1 . 16 a share .
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , inland closed yesterday at $ 35 . 875 a share , down $ 1 .
the company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market , especially in the automotive sector .
however , the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter .
third - quarter shipments slipped 7 % from the year - ago period , and 17 % from this year ' s second quarter .
analysts noted that the disappointing results do n ' t reflect lower prices for steel products .
structural steel , which primarily serves the construction market , was especially hurt by a 15 % price drop , mr . bradford said .
the company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material , repair and maintenance , and labor costs .
the increased labor costs became effective aug . 1 under terms of the four - year labor agreement with the united steel ##work ##ers union .
the ` ` seismic ' ' activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth .
america ' s financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully ` ` after ##sho ##ck - resistant . ' '
investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information .
that structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquid ##ity .
and liquid ##ity is what markets need to damp quake ##s and after ##sho ##cks .
when they halt trading , all market liquid ##ity is gone .
last friday the 13th - l ##rb - as well as two years ago this week - rr ##b - the markets became un ##link ##ed .
lack of important , needed information can cause fear .
and in financial markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe .
contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquid ##ity to the market as a whole .
what market makers provide is im ##media ##cy , a very valuable service .
it is a market attribute - - the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news .
market makers buy what investors wish to sell ; their business is res ##elling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors , and at a profit .
last friday ' s market g ##yra ##tions did not result in severe ` ` after ##sho ##cks . ' '

the economy ' s stu ##tter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up .
so often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane .
for the past seven years , investors have had the wind at their backs , in the form of a generally growing economy .
some may have forgotten - - and some younger ones may never have experienced - - what it ' s like to invest during a recession .
different tactics are called for , as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tough ##er .
a heavy dose of cash is prescribed , along with a heavier - than - usual all ##ot ##ment to bonds - - prefer ##ably government bonds .
it ' s tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand .
but that may not be possible , because recession ##s often take investors by surprise .
` ` they always seem to come a bit later than you expect .
the reason is simple , mr . w ##ys ##s says : ` ` interest rates almost always decline during recession . ' '
as surely as a sees ##aw tilt ##s , falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds .
they are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do .
that effect holds true for both short - term and long - term bonds .
but short - term bonds ca n ' t rise too much , because everyone knows they will be red ##eem ##ed at a pre ##set price fairly soon .
long - term bonds , with many years left before maturity , swing more widely in price .
corporate bonds ` ` are usually not a good bet in a recession , ' ' mr . w ##ys ##s says .
as times get tough ##er , investors fr ##et about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts .
also , he notes , ` ` most corporate bonds are call ##able . ' '
when interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for corporations to do just that ; they then save on interest costs .
but the investors are left stranded with money to rein ##ves ##t at a time when interest rates are pun ##y .
if corporate bonds are bad in recession ##s , junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all .
` ` such bonds are very sensitive to the downs ##ide , and this could be a disaster . ' '
municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession , but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government .
during an economic slump , local tax revenues often go down , raising the risks associated with at least some municipal ##s .
and , like corporate ##s , many municipal bonds are call ##able .
but a few experts , going against the consensus , do n ' t think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the off ##ing .
investors , he advises , ` ` should be cautious , ' ' holding fewer stocks than usual and also shu ##nni ##ng bonds .
greg con ##fa ##ir , president of sigma financial inc . in allen ##town , pa . , also recommends that investors go heavily for cash .
he is n ' t sure a recession is coming , but says the other likely alternative - - reign ##ited inflation - - is just as bad .
a soft landing is n ' t something that can be achieved once and for all , mr . con ##fa ##ir adds .
it has to be engineered over and over again , month after month .
it comes down to a question of whether to try to ` ` time ' ' the market .
for people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad , stocks have been reward ##ing long - term investments .
that ' s well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid .
moreover , because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming , some analysts think investors should n ' t even worry too much about timing .
` ` trying to time the economy is a mistake , ' ' says david katz , chief investment officer of value matrix management inc . in new york .
mr . katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years .
investors who listened , and light ##ened up on stocks , ` ` have just hurt themselves , ' ' he says .
and the in - and - outer might miss the sudden spur ##ts that account for much of the stock market ' s gains over time .
still , few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming .
after all , in all five recession ##s since 1960 , stocks declined .
about six months before a recession ends , stocks typically begin to rise again , as investors anti ##ci ##pate a recovery .
but whatever their advice about timing , none of these experts recommend jett ##ison ##ing stocks entirely during a recession .
for the portion of an investor ' s portfolio that stays in stocks , professionals have a number of suggestions .
mr . katz advocates issues with low price - earnings ratios - - that is , low prices in relation to the company ' s earnings per share .
` ` low p - e ' ' stocks , he says , vastly out ##per ##form others ` ` during a recession or bear market . ' '
in good times , he says , they la ##g a bit , but overall they provide superior performance .
prof . ar ##bel urges investors to disc ##ard stocks in small companies .
small - company shares typically fall more than big - company stocks in a recession , he says .
for example , mr . ar ##bel says , stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow .
- l ##rb - cash flow , basically earnings plus de ##pre ##ciation , is one common gauge of a company ' s financial health . - rr ##b -
that ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19 . 7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock - market crash , mr . ar ##bel says .
and it ' s way above the ratio - l ##rb - 7 . 5 times cash flow - rr ##b - that bigger companies are selling for .
another major trick in making a portfolio recession - resistant is choosing stocks in ` ` defensive ' ' industries .
food , tobacco , drugs and utilities are the classic examples .
recession or not , people still eat , smoke , and take medicine when they ' re sick .
george putnam iii , editor of turn ##around letter in boston , offers one final tip for recession - wary investors .
` ` keep some money available for opportunities , ' ' he says .
` ` if the recession does hit , there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the black ##est . ' '

bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt .
but while the overall market improved , the new - issue junk - bond market continued to count casualties , even as junk - bond prices rose .
yesterday , pr ##ude ##ntial - bach ##e securities inc . said it postponed a $ 220 million senior subordinate ##d de ##ben ##ture offering by york international corp .
the issue by chicago & north western is one of the so - called good junk - bond offerings on the new - issue calendar .
last week , the grand union offering was sweet ##ened to include warrant ##s that allow bond ##holders to acquire common stock .
pr ##ude ##ntial - bach ##e said the york issue was delayed because of market conditions .
portfolio managers say sweet ##ener ##s like equity kicker ##s and strict ##er protective covenant ##s may increasingly be required to sell junk - bond deals .
if you ' re going to take the risk in this market , you want something extra . ' '
while they consider the chicago & north western issue to be good , they do n ' t view it as the best .
the bonds are expected to have a 14 1 \ / 2 % coup ##on rate .
donaldson lu ##fk ##in declined to comment on the restructuring .
that would leave the blacks ##tone fund with a 60 % stake and donaldson lu ##fk ##in with 15 % .
despite the problems with new issues , high - yield bonds showed gains in the secondary , or res ##ell , market .
the gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is mode ##rating while the economy slow ##s .
that raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower .
the labor department reported that consumer prices rose just 0 . 2 % last month , slightly lower than some economists had expected .
but there were also rumors yesterday that several japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolio ##s and buying long - term bonds while selling shorter - term treasury ##s .
short - term treasury securities ended narrowly mixed , with two - year notes posting slight declines while three - year notes were slightly higher .
yesterday , the fed executed four - day matched sales , a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system .
the closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans .
it is considered an early signal of fed credit policy changes .
` ` the fact that they did four - day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively .
meanwhile , the treasury sold $ 9 . 75 billion of 52 - week bills yesterday .
the average yield on the bills was 7 . 35 % , down from 7 . 61 % at the previous 52 - week bill auction sept . 21 .
yesterday ' s yield was the lowest since 7 . 22 % on july 27 .
rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
thus , higher bidding narrows the investor ' s return while lower bidding widen ##s it .
the percentage rates are calculated on a 360 - day year , while the coup ##on - equivalent yield is based on a 365 - day year .
junk bond price climbed yesterday despite ski ##tti ##sh ##ness in the new - issue market for high - yield securities .
activity was brisk in the high - grade general obligation market , as a series of sell lists hit the street and capped upward price movement in the sector .
there was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank ' s portfolio ##s .
away from the general obligation sector , activity was modest .

figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of night train express , most people have little trouble saying no to proposition ##s like this .
but healthy skepticism vanish ##es when they are sol ##ici ##ted by an organized charity to help fight cancer , famine , child abuse , or what have you .
most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals .
in a distress ##ing number of cases , no .
last year , more than $ 100 billion was donated to the nation ' s 400 , 000 charities .
in many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dr ##ib ##ble of cash was left for the purported ben ##ef ##icia ##ries .
the service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program .
roughly a third of the charities reviewed flu ##nk the test .
which , it should be added , does n ' t prevent the charities from ra ##king in a lot of money anyway .
` ` a lot of donors just get taken . ' '
including those , he contend ##s , who put about $ 1 million into the kitty for the connecticut association of concerned veterans and the vietnam veterans service center .
the telephone number for the charity in shelton , con ##n . , has been disconnected , and the former officials could n ' t be located .
running a charity does cost money , but rep ##utable organizations manage to get the lion ' s share of donations out to where they are really needed .
with some other charities , however , it s the other way around .
by the time it paid its expenses it only had $ 120 , 000 left - - not enough to treat even one child .
meanwhile , a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on sol ##ici ##ting funds .
enforce ##rs ca n ' t put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion ' s share of their income on fund raising .
this puts upon enforce ##rs the burden of proving outright fraud or mis ##re ##pres ##entation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
in making cases , the authorities frequently zero in on alleged mis ##re ##pres ##entation ##s made by the charities ' fund raise ##rs .
illinois , for instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities sol ##ici ##ting there .
enforce ##rs pay special attention to operators using sweeps ##take ##s prizes as an additional induce ##ment to give .
the suit is still pending in illinois state court .
watson & hugh ##ey has denied the allegations in court ; officials decline to comment further .
while they can target some of the most obvious mis ##cre ##ants , enforce ##rs con ##cede that they are only scratching the surface .
there are so many cunning pl ##oys used by so many dubious operators , they say , that it is probably impossible to stop them all .
one maneuver : the ` ` public education ' ' ga ##mbit .
the sol ##ici ##tation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alert ##ing and informing the public about some health or other issue .
what it does n ' t say is that the entire ` ` campaign ' ' may be the fund - raising letter itself .
` ` a few boiler ##plate warnings about cancer appear but that ' s only two inches in all four pages .
officials at the washington d . c . - based charity did n ' t return repeated phone calls .
many fly - by - night charities ride the coat ##tails of the biggest , best - known and most rep ##utable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .
the established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it .
` ` we ca n ' t police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name .
and sometimes a rep ##utable charity with a household name gets used and does n ' t even know it .

specifically , the british carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for ua ##l .
the carrier stopped short of saying it would n ' t at some point rec ##ons ##ider participating in any new bid for ua ##l .
collectively , the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for ua ##l will ever get off the ground .
however , in response to the british air decision , united ' s pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy - out .
pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without british air ' s participation .
ua ##l declined to comment on british air ' s statement .
the united flight - attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake .

indeed , british air seemed to be di ##stan ##cing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment .
the carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its american counterparts .
most of the department ' s statements since the northwest transaction indicated it planned to curt ##ail foreign ownership stakes in u . s . carriers .
even before british air ' s announcement , pilot union leaders had been meeting in chicago yesterday to consider their options .
they have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction .

the plan was complete except for finishing touches , and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday .
afterward , leaders of the di ##ssi ##dent democrats re ##lent ##ed , and said they would n ' t offer their own proposal as they had planned .
the decision is a set ##back for president bush , who needs the support of democrats to pass the tax cut through the democratic - controlled senate .
having a proposal sponsored by democrats would have given the president an advantage .
having only a republican measure makes the task harder .
he said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the democratic leadership might erect .
but sen . mitchell , bu ##oy ##ed by his victory among fellow democrats , strongly disagreed .
mr . mitchell has been predicting that the president ' s initiative would fail this year .
the house version of the bill does include the tax cut .
the exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years .
the exclusion would apply to assets sold after oct . 1 .
as an alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
that rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years .
current ira ##s could be rolled over into the new ira ##s , but would be subject to tax though no penalty .
west ##more ##land coal co . , realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity , reported sharply improved third - quarter results .
for the year - earlier period , the company reported a loss of $ 520 , 000 or six cents a share .
in the latest nine months , the company earned $ 8 . 5 million , or $ 1 . 03 a share .
last year ' s net loss of $ 3 , 52 ##4 , 000 included a benefit of $ 1 , 640 , 000 from an accounting change .
revenue for the nine months rose to $ 44 ##9 million from $ 441 . 1 million .
in addition , long - term debt has been trimmed to about $ 72 million from $ 96 million since jan . 1 .
he predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters .

for the past couple of years , west ##more ##land has undertaken an aggressive stream ##lining of all aspects of its business .
the size of the company ' s board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 .
about 140 sal ##ari ##ed management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated .
for example , the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits ; the company used to pay 100 % .
` ` much of what we set out to do is completed . ' '
one difference , he said , is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer work ##day ##s because of holidays and the hunting season .
` ` i do n ' t want to give the impression that everybody can relax now , ' ' he said .
` ` we have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient .
it ' s a process that never really ends . ' '
for all of 1988 , the company reported an after - tax operating loss of $ 134 , 000 on revenue of $ 59 ##3 . 5 million .
an accounting adjustment made net income $ 1 . 5 million , or 18 cents a share .
some of the coal the plants buy will come from west ##more ##land mines .
mr . hutchinson predicted that the unit ' s contribution to company results in the 1990s ` ` will be exciting . ' '
he said west ##more ##land is looking at investment stakes in other co ##gen ##eration plants east of the mississippi river .
west ##more ##land expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2 . 5 % range in the early 1990s .
` ` we see coal ' s piece of the action growing , ' ' mr . hutchinson said .
` ` coal prices , while not sky ##rock ##eti ##ng , will grow modest ##ly in real terms , we think .
the current transaction cost the bank approximately $ 140 million .
of that amount , $ 20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself .
the move is part of chase ' s strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof .
the headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 chase manhattan plaza .
chase senior vice president george scandal ##ios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations .
as the building ' s new owner , chase will have its work cut out for it .
new york real estate broker ##age edward s . gordon co . will have the difficult task of finding new tenants .

wall street , shake hands with george or ##well .
wall street has n ' t gotten that far yet , but it has made a promising start .
for example , we ' ll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago .
according to some of the grand pan ##jan ##drum ##s of the market , it never happened .
in their lexi ##con the 50 ##8 - point collapse in the dow jones industrial average on oct . 19 , 1987 , was just a big b ##lip .
in the ` ` technical correction ' ' of two years ago , they lost a who ##pping 22 . 6 % . - rr ##b -
customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock .
either way , the word ` ` broker ' ' is clearly out of favor .
of the major new york - based securities firms , only morgan stanley & co . still calls its sales ##pe ##ople broker ##s .
at merrill lynch & co . and shear ##son lehman hutton inc . , they are ` ` financial consultants . ' '
at pain ##ew ##eb ##ber inc . , they are ` ` investment executives . ' '
such titles are designed to convey a sense of dig ##nified , broad - scale competence and expertise in selling today ' s myriad financial products .
` ` it s almost product de jo ##ur , ' ' gr ##ouse ##s one account executive at dean wit ##ter .
the names of some of these products do n ' t suggest the risk involved in buying them , either .
a case in point : ` ` government - plus ' ' bond funds .
what could imply more safety than investing in government bonds ?
what could be better than getting a tad more income from them - l ##rb - the plus - rr ##b - than other people ?
when a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tar ##nished , look for wall street to give it a new moniker .
in such cases , the game has n ' t changed , only the name .
in others a familiar old name still pre ##va ##ils , but the underlying game has changed .
for example , ` ` no load ' ' mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n ' t carry a front ##end sales commission .
getting out of them , however , may be a different story now .
should n ' t they properly be called exit - load funds ?
the mutual - fund industry is debating the question , but do n ' t expect a new name while the old one is working so well .
also , blue chips in general have suffered much more short - term price vol ##ati ##lity in recent years .
blue chips , he says , ` ` are now being referred to as poker chips . ' '
finally , even the time - honored strategy called ` ` value investing ' ' no longer means what it once did .
to institutional investors or broker ##s , he adds , a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up .

if the whole story were told , it would read something like this :

in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , the company closed yesterday at $ 45 . 50 a share , up 25 cents .
within two days , he was on his way to new york and tokyo to meet with top brass at sony .
there was just one sticking point : the two had a prior commitment .
sony promptly counters ##ue ##d , charging warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the u . s . movie business .
and they are a very odd team in any case .
mr . gu ##ber was raised in boston and educated in new york .
he is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees .
mr . peters is a high - school drop ##out who came to fame as bar ##bra st ##re ##isan ##d ' s hair ##dre ##sser .
yet , they are far and away the most prolific producers in hollywood .
and despite their share of du ##ds , they make movies that make money .
that is a skill sony badly needs - - and warner is lo ##ath to lose .
mr . gu ##ber and mr . peters are n ' t universally loved in hollywood but they are well connected .
it falls to others to do the writing , directing and producing .
sometimes , as with ` ` batman , ' ' the pair really do make the film .
and when you ' re making a movie this big , you need all the help you can get , ' ' mr . de palma adds .
` ` i wish they were around 24 hours a day . ' '
and some movies seem to have been hurt by their ina ##tten ##tion .
` ` we ' ve had a few bombs , ' ' admits mr . peters .
` ` but by and large this company has only been profitable . ' '
he says his company ' s prowess at packaging and marketing ` ` is why we ' ll be good at columbia .
longtime hollywood associates describe mr . gu ##ber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two , a man with a flair for deal - making and marketing .
it ' s no accident that they ' ve been able to develop such successful material . ' '
he gets better reviews as a creative w ##hi ##z , an enthusiast , an idea man .
he also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did .
bar ##bra st ##re ##isan ##d made him famous .
he came to produce her records and her movies - - ` ` a star is born ' ' and ` ` the main event . ' '
mr . gu ##ber , by contrast , has been married to one woman for more than 20 years .
but for all their intellectual and stylistic differences , they make the perfect ` ` good cop , bad cop ' ' team , hollywood associates say .
` ` peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you ' re doing a deal , ' ' says one agent .
` ` if there ' s a problem , peter disappears , and all of a sudden jon shows up . ' '
mr . gu ##ber and mr . peters rub many people in hollywood the wrong way .
says mr . simpson : ` ` the script was un ##rea ##dable .
they got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit ' ' as executive producers .
mr . peters acknowledges that and says it ' s not unlike the situation he and mr . gu ##ber are in with warner .
` ` i was upset with roger , i fu ##mp ##ered and sc ##hm ##ump ##ered , ' ' says mr . peters .
` ` but he wanted to pursue his own dream , and he went . ' '
` ` jon peters will come barrel ##ing into a room , say he ' s got a great idea , and be gone .
peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific . . . . ' '
i think peter even made some deals with the gorilla ##s . ' '
universal studios was working on a competing film , but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co - produce the film with gu ##ber peters and warner .
ultimately , they paid more than $ 1 million for the rights .
- l ##rb - the sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband ' s followers .
but it is pu ##zzling to some hollywood executives that sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the warner situation first .
some note that sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring mr . gu ##ber and letting mr . peters stay on to fulfill the warner contract .
` ` this business is n ' t about personalities at the end of the day - - it s about whether the ink is red or black .
in the case of peter and jon , the ink has been very , very black . ' '
mr . gu ##ber got his start in the movie business at columbia two decades ago .
while gu ##ber peters produced a number of hits for warner and others , their record was n ' t always so impressive .
and the failures make it possible for warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ing ##rates .
the studio says it stuck with them ` ` even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for warner . ' '
on a number of occasions , he adds , he tried to get warner to buy gu ##ber peters outright .
` ` they always listened , but they never acted , ' ' mr . gu ##ber says .
but the mgm plan collapsed just two weeks later .
mr . gu ##ber and mr . peters say they got a look at the books and bal ##ked at the price .
their relationship with mr . sugar ##man sour ##ed shortly thereafter .
last may , he sold his 24 % stake in barr ##is to a passive australian investor and barr ##is was renamed gu ##ber peters entertainment co .
meanwhile , mr . gu ##ber and mr . peters had agreed to extend their warner agreement with the new five - year exclusive contract .
the new deal was considered the most generous of its kind , both financially and in terms of creative freedom .
the producers ' 28 % share of publicly held gu ##ber peters would net them an additional $ 50 million .
sony also agreed to ind ##em ##ni ##fy the producers against any liability to warner .
sony is paying a he ##ft ##y price for a company that had revenue of only $ 42 million last year .
gu ##ber peters stock , which traded as low as $ 6 a share last year , closed yesterday at $ 16 . 625 .
the two sides now are accusing each other of lying .
warner , in its court filing ##s , calls it ` ` a piece of fiction created for this litigation . ' '
for one thing , according to mr . daly , the producers requested a release in advance .
warner obviously does n ' t think that it is in its own interests to let mr . gu ##ber and mr . peters go off to columbia .
at the very least , mr . ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from sony .
and they say there are plenty of precedent ##s in hollywood for letting people out of contracts .
the sales pitch could n ' t sound better .
first , there ' s the name : ` ` asset - backed securities . ' '
better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing .
the assets backing the securities come from some of the country ' s biggest - - and most secure - - institutions .
their yields are higher than those of u . s . treasury issues .
and the booming market has already attracted many of the nation ' s biggest institutional investors .
the concept may be simple : take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to investors .
sk ##ept ##ics say the slightly higher returns are n ' t enough to compensate for the extra risk .
they warn that asset - backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them - - and those are hard to evaluate .
moreover , the securities were introduced only about 4 1 \ / 2 years ago ; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession .
` ` we do n ' t know how this whole market will work in a serious economic down ##turn . ' '
such concerns , however , have n ' t stopped asset - backed securities from becoming one of wall street ' s hottest new products .
since the spring of 1985 , financial al ##chemist ##s have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities .
they have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational - vehicle loans .
they have offered bundles of home ##e ##qui ##ty loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time - shares .
last year , there was an issue of ` ` death - backed bonds ' ' - - securities backed by loans to life - insurance policy ##holders .
some predict there will be ` ` third world bonds , ' ' backed by loans to brazil , argentina and other debt - ridden nations .
and the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit - card rec ##ei ##vable ##s , sometimes known as ` ` plastic bonds . ' '
` ` this is the hey ##day of debt , ' ' says james grant , editor of grant ' s interest rate observer , a newsletter .
` ` before the sun sets on the ' 80s , it seems nothing will be left un ##ho ##cked . ' '
the result is a $ 45 billion market , according to securities data co .
most issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions .
but wealthy individuals also have been jumping in , and lately broker ##s have been pushing smaller investors into the asset - backed market .
the entry fee is affordable : issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ 1 , 000 .
issues typically come with ` ` credit enhancement ##s , ' ' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings .
enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issue ##rs , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions .
but sk ##ept ##ics question whether asset - backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks .
consider a $ 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by ci ##ti ##bank credit - card rec ##ei ##vable ##s .
the triple - a - rated issue offered a yield of only about 0 . 5 percentage point above four - year treasury issues .
on a $ 10 , 000 investment , that ' s a difference of only $ 50 a year .
but for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless .
moreover , the interest on asset - backed securities is fully taxa ##ble , while interest on treasury issues is tax - free at the state and local level .
but mr . powers has purchased asset - backed issues for individuals with tax - def ##erre ##d accounts , such as retirement plans .
he points out that institutions buying asset - backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over treasury ##s than individuals buying smaller amounts .
another concern is liquid ##ity , or how easily a security can be converted into cash .
the secondary , or res ##ale , market for asset - backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for treasury issues .
that could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature .
that ' s particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time - share loans .
there are n ' t any such listings for asset - backed securities .
investors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guarantee ##ing the securities .
in other words , if there ' s a problem , do n ' t expect ci ##ti ##bank to come to the rescue .
the prospect ##us also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency .
take the ` ` credit enhancement ##s , ' ' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond - insurance company .
the letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities .
details of credit enhancement ##s vary widely from issue to issue .
but sk ##ept ##ics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government - guaranteed paper .
when you buy an asset - backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an ins ##urer could run into unexpected difficulties .
under ##writer ##s insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions .
but despite the credit enhancement ##s , despite the high ratings , some money managers still worry that a recession could wr ##eak havoc on the underlying assets .
at the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest - quality bonds they can find - - that is , treasury ##s .
that could widen the yield spread between treasury ##s and asset - backed securities , as well as make it tough ##er to un ##load the latter .
some analysts are especially wary of credit - card issues .
for one thing , credit - card loans are un ##se ##cured .
what about triple - a - rated asset - backed issues ?
` ` nope , we still say to stick with treasury ##s , ' ' mr . co ##rco ##ran replies .
ratings , he notes , ` ` are subject to change . ' '
all this makes asset - backed securities seem too risky for many people .
` ` more money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculation ##s , sc ##ams and fraud ##s of all time . ' '
mr . herman is a staff reporter in the wall street journal ' s new york bureau .
if you force financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence , it would probably be a one - word sentence : divers ##ify .
judging by a poll of wall street journal readers conducted this summer by er ##dos & morgan inc . , serious investors have taken that advice to heart .
nearly 1 , 000 investors responded to the journal ' s poll , providing an in - depth look at their portfolio ##s .
but only 17 . 5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market .
similarly , 57 % of respondents own shares in a money - market mutual fund , and 33 % own municipal bonds .
but only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives .
the poll , conducted aug . 7 - 28 , also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics .
it found them in a cautious , but not down ##beat , mood .
of 1 , 500 people sent a question ##naire , 95 ##1 replied .
the response rate , more than 63 % , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence .
the results ca n ' t be extra ##pol ##ated to all investors , though .
journal readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of between $ 75 , 000 and $ 99 , 000 .
the respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago .
for example , 12 % of this year ' s respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months .
last year , only 8 % were expecting a recession .
an additional 56 % of this year ' s respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months .
only 42 % of last year ' s respondents anticipated slowing growth .
apparently , the respondents do n ' t think that an economic slow ##down would harm the major investment markets very much .
a slim majority - l ##rb - 51 % - rr ##b - think stock prices will be higher in august 1990 than they were in august 1989 .
their verdict on real estate is almost the same .
some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months .
by contrast , only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold .
since gold tends to so ##ar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control .
even though only 12 % actually predicted a recession , many respondents were taking a better - safe - than sorry investment stance .
nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anti ##ci ##pate a possible recession .
for the most part , the changes were ` ` slight . ' '
a buy - and - hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents .
most own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more than three times a year .
some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year ; only 57 % had sold any .
but the lurking shadow of 1987 ' s stock - market crash still seems dark .
about 33 % considered another crash ` ` likely , ' ' while about 63 % said one is ` ` unlikely . ' '
those percentage ##s hardly changed from the previous year ' s poll .
and the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual .
about 60 % of them said they would ` ` or ##dina ##rily ' ' have at least 25 % of their money in stocks .
but as of august , only 50 % actually had stock - market investments of that size .
most stock - market index ##es were hitting all - time highs at around the time of the poll .
but it appears that many journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious , rather than a signal to jump on the band ##wa ##gon .

electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and di ##sg ##run ##tled employees is costing u . s . companies billions and er ##od ##ing their international competitive advantage .
that was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all - day conference on corporate electronic espionage .
any secret can be pirate ##d , the experts said , if it is transmitted over the air .
even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a vc ##r recorder .

already many foreign firms , especially banks , have their own crypt ##ographer ##s , conference speakers reported .
still , en ##cr ##yp ##ting corporate communications is only a partial remedy .
moreover , he said , technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they ' ve been ` ` erased ' ' from a computer ' s memory .
he said that oliver north of iran - contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read .

then we began to file out , to wait safely on terra firm ##a for the opening pitch .
it was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the stick that i really understood the point of all those walk ##men and watch ##men .
the crowd moved in cl ##ump ##s , cl ##ump ##s magnet ##ized around an electronic nucleus .
in this way , while the stick itself was black ##ed out , we kept up to date on events .
within 15 minutes of the quake itself , i was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the bay bridge .
increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before i got to my car .
by then , our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers .
everyone at the stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant .
in fact , the entire population of the bay area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience .
the reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters .
the tape was on tv before the night was out .
marshall mc ##lu ##han , you should have been there at that hour .
investors who received shear ##son lehman hutton inc . ' s latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions .
the first 10 pages of the 76 - page weekly portfolio perspective are completely blank , except for the page numbers .
rather than printing devils , shear ##son puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market .
the plunge made shear ##son ' s market commentary instantly out of date .
investors recalled that shear ##son last week had been advising that ` ` the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance . ' '
many other broker ##age firms had similarly bull ##ish views .
but mr . ri ##v ##kin insists that the 10 pages were n ' t pulled because they were too bull ##ish .
instead , he says , ` ` they were cautious , and that was n ' t the message we wanted to deliver ' ' on monday .
as mr . ri ##v ##kin explains it , ` ` we were raising some caution flags about rate rises in europe and concerns about the lb ##o market .
and by late friday afternoon , actually after the close , we decided that was the wrong tone to take .
with the market down , we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening . ' '
both before and after the friday plunge , shear ##son has maintained a recommended portfolio weight ##ing of 65 % stocks , 20 % bonds and 15 % cash .
they succeed robert w . ka ##sten and john r . parker , who reached the mandatory retirement age .
china ' s slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall .
retail sales are plum ##met ##ing , while consumer prices still are rising .
chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged st ##ag ##fl ##ation : low growth and high inflation .
` ` the economy is crashing hard , ' ' says an asian economist in beijing .
` ` the slow ##down is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastating ##ly than anyone had expected . ' '
a lengthy recession , if it material ##izes , would drain state co ##ffer ##s and create severe hardship ##s for urban workers .
experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth , rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit .
unless the government suddenly reverse ##s course , wages for most workers wo n ' t keep pace with inflation , creating a potential source of urban unrest .
- l ##rb - industrial output surged 21 % in 1988 , while inflation peaked last february at nearly 30 % . - rr ##b -
the slow ##down also results from chronic energy and raw - materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week .
in western , market - driven countries , recession ##s often have a bright side : pro ##dding the economy to greater efficiency .
in china , however , there is n ' t likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state .
nor are any of these in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt mono ##lit ##hs likely to be allowed to go bankrupt .
` ` when the going gets rough , china penal ##izes the efficient and rewards the inc ##omp ##ete ##nt , ' ' says a western economist .
reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major communist party pl ##en ##um for sometime in the next few weeks .
the meeting is expected to call for heightened aus ##ter ##ity for two years .
but with industrial growth st ##ag ##nant and inflation showing signs of easing , some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy .
some analysts believe china soon will begin relaxing economic controls , particularly by loosen ##ing credit .
that would benefit chinese enterprises as well as sino - foreign joint ventures , both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital .
a dangerous build ##up this year of billions of dollars in inter - company debts threatens , if un ##che ##cked , to bring the economy to a collapse .
the cycle has been repeated several times since china began reforming its planned economy in 1979 .
and , because china ' s leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy , it is likely to continue , analysts say .
output declined in several provinces , including jiangsu and zhejiang , two key coastal areas , and sichuan , the nation ' s agricultural bread ##basket .
production in shanghai , china ' s industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government , fell 1 . 8 % for the month .
in an unusually direct statement , the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shop ##keepers so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods .
` ` this will prevent a slide in industrial production , which will otherwise cause new panic buying ##s , ' ' the spokesman said .
real - estate executives are lobbying to ease anti - tax - shelter rules .
charitable groups are trying to reins ##tate the write - off for contributions made by individuals who do n ' t item ##ize their de ##duction ##s .
big auction houses want to make collect ##ible ##s eligible for lower capital - gains taxes .
and heavy - industry lobby ##ists are quietly discussing the possibility of reins ##tat ##ing the investment tax credit .
` ` everything is up for grabs , ' ' says theodore groom , a lobby ##ist for mutual life - insurance companies .
the catalyst has been the congressional move to restore prefer ##ential tax treatment for capital gains , an effort that is likely to succeed in this congress .
other fundamental ` ` reforms ' ' of the 1986 act have been threatened as well .
the house seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes .
the ben ##ef ##icia ##ries would range from pine ##apple grow ##ers to rich grandparents to tu ##xed ##o - rental shops .
but law ##makers of both parties agree that the stream ##lining was temporary .
other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts , including both the capital - gains and ira provisions .
` ` you ' ll see the annual un ##rave ##ling of it . ' '
many groups are n ' t waiting that long .
` ` it ' s a swiss - cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good , ' ' commented one veteran lobby ##ist who was watching the proceedings .
even lobby ##ists for heavy industry , one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill , are encouraged .
corporate lobby ##ist char ##ls walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve ` ` competitive ##ness . ' '
in reaction to proposed capital - gains legislation , groups are lobbying to make sure they are n ' t left off the gr ##av ##y train .
in the house - passed tax bill , mr . the ##ven ##ot got his wish ; real - estate assets are included in the capital - gains provision .
but so ##the ##by ' s , christie ' s and the national association of antique dealers are still trying to get theirs .
they have sent a letter to congressional tax - writers asking that gains from the sale of collect ##ible ##s also be given prefer ##ential treatment .
` ` collect ##ible ##s should continue to be recognized as capital assets , ' ' the letter states .
all of this talk is anti ##the ##tical to the tax reform act of 1986 .
the goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes .
this year congress , with pro ##dding from president bush , has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code .
it appears likely that , this year or next , some form of capital - gains preference and passive - loss restoration will be enacted .
other tax benefits probably will be restored and created .
the main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them .
` ` the ' 86 act was a flu ##ke .
so , is the tax code now open game again ?

raymond chandler , in a 1950 letter defending a weak hemingway book , likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher .
he does n ' t just walk off the mound and weep . ' '
chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career .
` ` champ ' ' chandler ' s last pitch , apparently , was a screw ##ball .
if it does not quite have chandler ' s special magic - - well , at the end , neither did chandler .
he wants to continue being a low - paid private eye , and she wants him to live off the million dollars she ' s settled on him .
the style throughout bears a strong resemblance to chandler ' s prose at its most par ##ed down .
all told , mr . parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect .

mr . nolan is a contributing editor at los angeles magazine .
ko shi ##oya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the japanese edition of reader ' s digest .
` ` japan has been a major import ##er of foreign information and news , ' ' says mr . shi ##oya .
` ` but one gets fed up with import ##ing information and news . ' '
today , he is publisher of business tokyo magazine , the first english - language business magazine devoted to coverage of japanese business .
and they are quietly linking up with u . s . publishing trade groups .
` ` the japanese take the long view . ' ' said mr . ve ##ron ##is .
japanese involvement in american publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as business tokyo are considered ground ##breakers .
when kei ##zai ##kai launched business tokyo in 1987 , it appealed to a more multinational audience .
american publishers appear more than ready to do some selling .
` ` before , they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft .
now they realize magazines are as much a franchise as na ##bis ##co is a franchise .

a charge of $ 80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results .
a spokesman said am ##oco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean - up project was responsible .
in the 1988 third quarter , the chicago - based oil company earned $ 55 ##2 million , or $ 1 . 07 a share .

aside from the special charge , am ##oco ' s results were in line with wall street estimates .
the company ' s stock ended at $ 48 . 375 , up 25 cents in new york stock exchange composite trading .
am ##oco is the first major oil company to report third - quarter results .
generally in the quarter , over ##pro ##duction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profit ##ability .

gasoline margins may rebound this quarter , some industry officials say , but they believe chemical margins could worse ##n .

for retailers , christmas , not halloween , promises to be this year ' s sp ##ook ##iest season .
many retailers fear a price war will er ##upt if cash - strapped companies such as camp ##eau corp . slash tags to spur sales .
concerns about the stock market , doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators .
even if there is n ' t any widespread discount ##ing , the outlook for industry profits is n ' t good .
industry observers expect a wide diver ##gence in performance .
says mr . ste ##id ##tman ##n : ` ` i ' m looking for a bi - polar christmas . ' '
economists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise 4 . 5 % to 6 % from year - ago figures .
but mr . ste ##id ##tman ##n predict ##s that healthy stores hawk ##ing mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25 % to 30 % .
thin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales .
catalog companies are likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year , particularly in december .
more than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low - cost federal express service that guarantees pre - christmas delivery of orders made by a certain date .
using federal express delivery last year , mr . st ##rum says , ` ` december was our biggest month . ' '
k mart corp . chairman joseph e . anton ##ini sum ##med up his outlook for the christmas season as ` ` not troubles ##ome . ' '
he ' s not predicting a blockbuster , but he is ` ` more optimistic than three months ago ' ' because employment remains strong and inflation low .
other retailers are also preparing for a ho - hum holiday .
` ` i ' m not looking for a runaway christmas at all , ' ' he says .
a consumer poll conducted in early september by leo j . shapiro & associates , a market researcher based in chicago , also suggests a modest holiday .
the results are almost identical to shapiro ' s september 1988 numbers .
retailers could get a boost this year from the calendar .
christmas falls on a monday , creating a big last - minute weekend opportunity for stores .
most will stay open late saturday night and open their doors again sunday .
but many consumers probably will use the extra time to put off some purchasing until the last minute .

now mr . bush will come to costa rica and encounter nicaragua ##n strong ##man daniel ortega , eager for photo opportunities with the u . s . president .
formally upgrading the sand ##ini ##sta ##s to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the costa rican press .
visiting nicaragua , he praised the sand ##ini ##sta ##s for their electoral system and chi ##ded the bush administration for not reward ##ing the sand ##ini ##sta ##s .
fitting ##ly , the tel ##a accord ##s were nicknamed by hon ##dur ##ans ` ` the dodd plan . ' '
he also called on nicaragua ' s neighbors to accept a ` ` military equilibrium ' ' guaranteed by both super ##power ##s .
the pentagon claims that in spite of moscow ' s words , east bloc weapons continue to flow into nicaragua through cuba at near - record levels .
the sad condition of u . s . policy in central america is best depicted by the recent end to u . s . sponsorship of radio costa rica .
a few months ago , the bush administration decided to stop this cooperation , leaving radio costa rica operating on a shoes ##tri ##ng .
according to news reports , the abrupt termination was due to fears that vo ##a transmissions could interfere with the peace process .
in the meantime , russia gave nicaragua another powerful radio transmitter , which has been installed in the city of este ##li .
it is capable of reaching the entire caribbean area and deep into north america .
perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the soviet condom ##inium being created in the ist ##hm ##us thanks to u . s . default .

fox , which also owns six tv stations , provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates .
a spoke ##sw ##oman for paramount said the company does n ' t comment on speculation .
calls to shelly sc ##hwa ##b , president of mca tv , were n ' t returned .
the two companies , like fox , already have their own tv stations .

fox said it plans to offer its stations movies , theatrical and made - for - tv ventures , probably on wednesday ##s , sometime next year .
it is also planning another night of original series .
a chris - craft station manager said there have been no formal talks .

banco popular de puerto rico and ban ##pon ##ce corp . - - agreed to merge in a transaction valued at $ 324 million .
under the agreement , ban ##pon ##ce stock ##holders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash .

the two companies , both based in san juan , will form a bank holding company with assets of just over $ 9 billion .

` ` banco popular just kept waiting , ' ' said edward thompson , a vice president and analyst at thomson bank ##watch inc . in new york .
` ` they got a transaction that ' s good for both companies . ' '
the two banks appear to be a good fit .
ban ##pon ##ce cater ##s to a more affluent customer , while banco popular has always had a large presence among middle - income and lower - income markets .
the merger should also allow the companies to reduce costs by combining operations in many locations in puerto rico .
` ` they ' re often right across the street from one another , ' ' mr . thompson said .
it makes sense from a strategic stand ##point . ' '
the newly merged company will have 165 branches in puerto rico and 27 branches outside of the island .
the banks said they do n ' t expect the merger to face any regulatory hurdles .
mr . carr ##ion said the merger should be completed in six to nine months .

in sacramento , a transportation department spokesman said he could n ' t immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work .
however , he asserted that the department had n ' t mastered the technology needed to retro ##fi ##t the entire cypress structure .
the cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes .
the state began such work after a 1971 tre ##mb ##lor in southern california , when numerous bridges collapsed .
knowledge ##able employees said the project had been st ##ym ##ied somewhat by ` ` the difficulty of designing ' ' the jackets .
the procedure involves en ##cas ##ing the concrete columns with steel , then connecting them more securely to the double - decker road ##bed .
the employees also said the project may have been s ##na ##gged by budget ##ary concerns .
one preliminary estimate put the retro ##fi ##tting cost at as much as $ 50 million .

the northern piers of the span lie in est ##ua ##rian deposits that were of a type to have li ##que ##fied easily during the 1906 quake .
transportation department officials , however , said they were as surprised as anyone by the cypress destruction .
they said previous earthquakes suggested that multiple - column viaduct ##s would stand up well , although they were working on ways to bo ##lster them .
he said : ` ` we know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to ' ' reinforce the columns .

a maxim of frankfurt banking holds that wherever deutsche bank goes , other west german banks follow .
indeed , at least four other west german banks are believed to be making inquiries .

democracy can be cruel to politicians : sometimes it forces them to make choices .
now that the supreme court opened the door on the subject of abortion , politicians are squinting under the glare of democratic choice .
their discomfort is a healthy sign for the rest of us .
republicans are squinting most painfully , at least at first , which is only fair because they ' ve been shielded the most .
so long as abortion was a question for litigation , not legislation , republicans could find political security in abs ##ol ##uti ##sm .
much of washington thought it detected george bush in a characteristic wa ##ffle on abortion the past week .
only a month ago he ' d warned congress not to pass legislation to pay for abortion ##s in cases of rape or inc ##est .
last friday , after congress passed it anyway , he hinted he was looking for compromise .
was the man who once was pro - choice , but later pro - life , converting again ?
in fact , mr . bush ' s dance was more wig ##gle than wa ##ffle .
pro - life advocates say the white house never wave ##red over the veto .
amid charges of ` ` tim ##idi ##ty ' ' on panama and elsewhere , the president was n ' t about to off ##end his most energetic constituency .
in last week ' s house vote , 41 republicans defected .
after the vote , connecticut rep . nancy johnson rounded up nearly as many signatures on a letter to mr . bush urging him not to veto .
the senate passed the same bill yesterday , with a veto - proof majority of 67 .
the man ##ue ##ver ##ing illustrates an emerging republican don ##ny ##brook , pac ##ified since the early 1980s .
at the 1988 go ##p convention , abortion was barely discussed at all , though delegates were evenly divided on the question of an anti - abortion constitutional amendment .
ms . johnson made a passionate statement to the platform committee , but she was talking to herself .
eddie ma ##he , a republican consultant , says the two go ##p candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first .
but mr . ma ##he adds , ` ` the net loser in the next few years is the right - to - life side . ' '
but the supreme court ' s opening of debate may have changed even that .
polls are no substitute for principle , but they ' ll do for some politicians .
the republican danger is that abortion could become for them what it ' s long been for democrats , a di ##vis ##ive lit ##mus test .
it ' s already that in the bush administration , at least for any job in which abortion is even remotely an issue .
oklahoma official robert fulton lost a chance for a senior job in the department of health and human services after right - to - life activists opposed him .
caldwell butler , a conservative former congressman , was barred from a legal services post , after he gave wrong answers on abortion .
in the case of h ##hs secretary louis sullivan , the lit ##mus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the republican coalition .
their views on health care and welfare did n ' t much matter , though h ##hs spends billions a year on both .
it makes only a handful of abortion - related decisions .
though democrats can g ##lo ##at at all this for now , they may want to contain their glee .
eventually even republicans will find a way to frame the issue in ways that expose pro - choice abs ##ol ##uti ##sm .
does the candidate favor parental consent for teen - age abortion ##s ?
- l ##rb - the pro - choice lobby does n ' t .
- rr ##b - what about banning abortion ##s in the second and third trim ##ester ##s ?
- l ##rb - the lobby says no again . - rr ##b -
democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise , toward the un ##pol ##ari ##zing middle .
roe v . wade pre - em ##pt ##ed political debate , so the extremes blossom ##ed .
now the am ##bi ##valent middle , a moral majority of sorts , is re ##asse ##rting itself .
within a few years , the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted , but not completely banned .
this is where the voters are , which is where politicians usually end up .

first they get us to buy computers so we can get more information .
then the computers give us more information than we can ever read .
now they plan to sell us products that si ##ft through all the information to give us what we really want to know .
the products range from computer - edited , personal newsletter ##s to systems that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires .
` ` most people read 10 times more than necessary in order to find out what they really need . ' '
mr . good ##fell ##ow has started a men ##lo park , cal ##if . , company called anterior technology that provides human editors for public electronic networks .
` ` i see it as a sewage treatment plant , ' ' he says .
one early user , david se ##mmel , a chicago venture capitalist and investor in desktop data , says he uses it to track takeover developments .
` ` i ' m pretty confident i ' m catching everything , ' ' he says .
and it works best in high - powered personal computers .
but some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic .
this is the first time i ' ve seen something i could imagine a lot of people using . ' '
an fm receiver attached to a user ' s personal computer receives the information .
some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire items as they come in .
george goodwin , an account manager at royal bank of canada , adapted a lotus development corp . program called agenda to sort through international news wires .
it automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas .
for those who do n ' t need their personal ##ized information moment by moment , some services are offering overnight newsletter ##s .
one early user is nec corp . ' s u . s . printer marketing arm .
` ` they want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition , ' ' mr . am ##ram says .
it also tracks personnel and financial announcements by nec ' s distributors and customers .
individual inc . ' s technology goes beyond word searches by using a computer ##ized the ##saurus .
it compares the position of key words in the story ; words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value .
and it calculate ##s how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base .
the higher the ratio of hits to total words , the higher the presumed value to the reader .
` ` the computers find all the key words they can , but the editors confirm every one .
computer picking is n ' t perfect , ' ' says harvey go ##lom ##b , president and founder of pin ##point .
the humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications .
mr . go ##lom ##b says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletter ##s a night .
many computer network users who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically .
a program called notes , which is under development by lotus , also is designed to sort e - mail sent within work groups .
one thing that makes e - mail difficult to si ##ft through is that each item looks the same .
notes , which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics , allows mail send ##ers to put different logos on their mail .
a daily news briefing from the company librarian , for example , would have a distinctive format on the screen , just as a paper version would have .
` ` with notes , they ' re visually distinct .

the 100 - foot - long mural , painted by james da ##ugh ##erty in 1934 , was commissioned by the federal works project administration .
throughout the 1970s , stamford school and city officials made no effort to locate the mural .
in 1986 , stamford officials thanked mr . ho ##el ##zer for taking care of the mural - - and demanded he return it as soon as possible .
mr . ho ##el ##zer , however , sued stamford , claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it .
mr . ho ##el ##zer did n ' t return phone calls seeking comment on the judge ' s decision .
the judge ordered that a hearing be held nov . 17 to determine how much the city should pay mr . ho ##el ##zer for his services .
she said the mural ` ` preserves an era in stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done .
the prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the soviet union is keeping up its dizzy ##ing october buying bing ##e of u . s . corn .
that pace is causing some analysts to spec ##ulate that the soviet union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons .
one sign that more soviet purchases are possible is that u . s . grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts .
that sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn .
by some estimates , several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn .
by buying futures contracts , these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are ob ##liga ##ted to deliver .
rumors of soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soy ##be ##an futures contracts .
the harvest delays , however , are expected to be temporary .
bal ##my temperatures are forecast for next week , said robert le ##k ##berg , an analyst at farmers grain & livestock corp . , chicago .
many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies .
the heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally .
a number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders .
december delivery gold fell $ 1 . 80 an ounce to $ 370 . 60 .
december silver eased 2 . 7 cents an ounce to $ 5 . 133 .
january platinum was down $ 3 . 60 an ounce at $ 49 ##1 . 10 .
he noted that the ` ` core inflation rate , ' ' which exclude ##s food and energy , was also low at 0 . 2 % .
both are in great need of foreign exchange , and south africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments , he said .
` ` putting it all together , we have a negative scenario that does n ' t look like it will improve overnight , ' ' he said .
the december contract rose 1 . 50 cents a pound to $ 1 . 279 ##5 .
in recent days , however , there has been increased purchasing of copper in london , an analyst said .
west texas intermediate for november delivery fell 14 cents a barrel to $ 20 . 42 .
but so - called outer month contracts finished higher .
for instance , december contracts for w ##ti rose 17 cents to $ 20 . 42 .
most energy futures opened lower , following wednesday ' s market down ##turn .

heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well .
melvin bell ##i ' s san francisco law offices may have been the epic ##enter of legal activity after tuesday ' s earthquake .
suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms , contractors and developers , as well as against local - government agencies .
but lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge .
experts on california tor ##t law say protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty iron ##cl ##ad .
even claims against individuals and companies face significant road ##block ##s .
the major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an ` ` act of god . ' '
we still have people wandering around in a daze in san francisco worrying about whether it ' s going to rain tonight . ' '
but that wo n ' t stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuver ##ing .
in san francisco , they argue , an earthquake was a near certainty .
he adds that ` ` they were aware of the prop ##ens ##ity for earthquakes and the san andreas fault . ' '
` ` we wo n ' t know until the smoke clears - - but yes , we ' re looking into it , ' ' he says .
mr . bell ##i says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage .
plaintiffs , he says , will argue that damaged structures were n ' t built to proper design standards .
government entities , continues mr . ru ##vo ##lo , could be protected by the california government tor ##t liability act .
` ` the legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability . ' '
the state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards , says mr . covert .
he believes those defenses might well apply to the bay bridge collapse .
nevertheless , he adds , ` ` i would n ' t get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the bay bridge . ' '
if there ' s going to be a race to the courthouse , it has n ' t started yet .
wednesday , mr . bell ##i ' s staff was n ' t permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety .
he said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town - house office and helped victims apply for federal aid - - free of charge .
in a news release issued by mr . dr ##ivo ##n , the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims .
the association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that sol ##ici ##tation of business is une ##thic ##al .
apparently a lot , according to the british firm of del ##oit ##te , has ##kins & sells .
the british del ##oit ##te firm recently withdrew from the merger of del ##oit ##te and touch ##e world - wide and joined cooper ##s & l ##y ##brand .
mr . bullock said the british firm has used the name ` ` del ##oit ##te ' ' since 1845 .
mr . cook said that last june , the international executive commit ##tes of del ##oit ##te and touch ##e agreed to a world - wide merger .
in england , this would mean that the british del ##oit ##te would lose revenue for its audit of gm ' s va ##ux ##hill unit .
he also declined to comment on the name that cooper ##s would use in england if del ##oit ##te uk won its litigation to keep its name .
cooper ##s uses the cooper ##s & l ##y ##brand name world - wide .
william bennett , the white house drug - policy director , accused local officials in the washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers .
without more space to inca ##rce ##rate convicted criminals , he added , ` ` we will not win the war on drugs . ' '
the drug c ##zar claimed that enforcement efforts are working here , ` ` albeit at a slower and more halt ##ing pace than we would like . ' '
he acknowledged , however , that washington ' s ` ` drug - related murder rate is into ##ler ##ably high .
drugs continue to be sold openly around schools , parks and housing projects . ' '
mr . bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have imp ##eded plans for building more federal prisons to ease washington ' s problem .
but other bush administration officials have criticized maryland gov . william sc ##hae ##fer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state .
administration officials also have said that washington mayor marion barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city .
of his successes in washington , mr . bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .
others say they feel confident that steps they ' ve already taken would see them through a disaster .
prepared ##ness involves more than flashlight ##s and fire alarms these days .
some big companies have teams of in - house experts focusing on safety and business res ##ump ##tion .
many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up con ##ting ##ency offices in safe regions , hoping they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly .
that means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm ' s way .
` ` if you do n ' t save your critical people , you wo n ' t be able to bring up your vital business functions . ' '
` ` you need to capital ##ize on these moments when you have everyone ' s attention , ' ' she says .
` ` it was a good reminder that we all need to prepare prior to an event . ' '
the arc ##o memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work , such as solid shoes and ` ` heavy gloves to clear debris . ' '
it also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter .
arc ##o maintains an office in dallas that would take over if payroll operations in pasadena were disrupted .
the arc ##o plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are bus ##ier at certain times of the year .
this way , depending on when a quake might strike , priorities can be assigned to departments that should be brought back on line first .
at he ##wl ##ett - packard co . , the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures .
` ` we were talking about scheduling a practice drill for november , ' ' says joan tha ##rp , a spoke ##sw ##oman .
` ` then we had a real one in the afternoon . ' '
the palo alto , cal ##if . , computer maker scrambled to set up a special phone line to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home wednesday .
sales and service employees were asked to report to work to help bay area clients who called with computer problems .
he ##wl ##ett - packard also called in its systems experts to restore its own computer operations .
` ` that means we can accept orders ' ' and begin getting back to normal , says ms . tha ##rp .
as it turned out , bank employees were n ' t hurt and the vaults with ##sto ##od the jolt ##s .
some companies are confident that they ' re prepared .
the company also maintains rec ##har ##ge ##able flashlight ##s in offices and changes its stand ##by supply of drinking water every three months .
` ` we feel we are doing everything we can , ' ' an o ##cci ##dent ##al spokesman says .
the centers are complete with maps detailing utility lines beneath rides and ` ` safe haven ##s ' ' where people can be assembled away from major structures .
hurricane hugo , an atlantic storm , did n ' t affect vista .
but two other major storms have threatened operations so far this year , most recently hurricane jerry this week .
the company does n ' t wait until the final hours to get ready for hurricanes .

` ` empty tank cars will float away on you if you get a big tidal surge . ' '
still , vista officials realize they ' re relatively fortunate .

mai ##tre ' d claims in suit that restaurant fired her because she was pregnant .

investors celebrated the second anniversary of black monday with a buying sp ##ree in both stocks and bonds .
stock and bond investors were cheered by last month ' s encouraging ##ly low inflation rate .
this news raised hopes for further interest - rate cuts .
treasury - bond prices immediately rallied , setting the stock market rolling from the opening bell .
that brought the average ' s cumulative gain this week to about 114 points .
the stock - market rally was led by blue - chip issues , but , unlike monday ' s rebound , was broadly based .
indeed , over - the - counter stocks , led by technology issues , out ##lea ##ped the industrial average .
many takeover - related stocks rose after news that a group obtained financing commitments for the proposed buy - out of american medical international inc .

fed officials probably wo n ' t drive down rates immediately , mr . keith said .

this phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session .

volume on the new york stock exchange rose to 198 . 1 million shares from 166 . 9 million wednesday .
gaining big board issues outnumbered decline ##rs by 1 , 235 to 355 .
in new york late yesterday , it was at 141 . 70 yen , up from 141 . 45 yen late wednesday .
but it fell to 1 . 84 ##70 marks from 1 . 84 ##85 .
now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 % .
as we know , voters tend to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for congress .
prior to 1932 , the pattern was nearly the opposite .
a simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by americans in the voting booth .
each legislator , after all , is only one out of 53 ##5 when it comes to national policy making .
in races for the white house , a voter ' s incentive , at the margin , is to lean republican .
the individual voter ' s standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes .
while this theory is exceeding ##ly simple , it appears to explain several things .
third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit - seeking have lower security in office .
for example , first - term members of the house , once the most vulnerable of incumbent ##s , have become virtually immune to defeat .
fourth , the theory indicates why the republican party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office .
potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent .
fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the south .
finally , the theory suggests why republicans generally have fare ##d better in senate races than in campaigns for the house .
three pieces of evidence co ##rro ##bor ##ate the key assumption that democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than their republican colleagues .
this is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the house .
the democratic house attendance rate has not exceeded the republican house attendance rate since 1959 .
moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level .
state government is more typically split along republican - governor \ / democratic - legislature lines than the reverse .
mr . zu ##pan teaches at the university of southern california ' s business school .
the measure before the conference yesterday funds the departments of state , justice and commerce through fiscal 1990 .
elsewhere in the commerce department , nearly $ 191 . 2 million is preserved for assistance programs under the economic development administration .
the bill also provides $ 620 . 5 million to meet u . s . contributions to international organizations and $ 80 million for peace - keeping activities .
both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal 1989 , although the amount for peace - keeping shows a 27 % cut from the administration ' s request .

a good place to start the rehabilitation is a ` ` legislative line - item veto ' ' bill now being offered by indiana senator dan coats .
congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50 % majority , but then a president could veto that rejection .
congress would then need the usual two - thirds majority to over ##ride any veto .
the proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the 1974 budget ` ` reform ' ' act .
before 1974 , a president could ` ` imp ##ound , ' ' or refuse to spend , funds appropriated by congress .
presidents kennedy and johnson were both big users of the imp ##ound ##ment power , but congress saw its chance against a weakened president nixon and stripped it away .
today a president can still send up spending res ##cis ##sions , but they ' re meaningless unless congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind .
this is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens , and naturally res ##cis ##sions are almost never approved .
in 1987 , president reagan sent 73 res ##cis ##sions back to the hill , but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by congress .
senator coats ' s proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless congress acts .
mr . coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month .
president bush has endorsed the idea , and at least 50 sitting senators have voted to support enhanced res ##cis ##sion authority in the past .
` ` it ' s impossible to put an exact figure on it at this time . ' '
the office of management and budget has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs .
one of the last big employers in the silicon valley to report in , sea ##gate technology , said it expects to be back at full strength monday .
the day before the quake , sea ##gate completed three days of emergency training and drills .
the city ' s recovery from the earthquake was uneven .
city crews tall ##ied the wreckage to buildings , but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled .
among the city ' s banks , bank of america said all but eight of its 850 branches were open .
the closed branches , in san francisco , hayward , santa clara and santa cruz , sustained structural damage .
power failures kept just seven of its 1 , 500 automated - teller machines off - line .
only five of 49 ##6 branches statewide remain closed , while 23 of 600 automated - teller machines remained out of order .
the most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake ' s epic ##enter , 80 miles south of san francisco .
santa cruz county estimates total damage at nearly $ 600 million .
santa clara county has a running total so far of $ 50 ##4 million , excluding the hard - hit city of los ga ##tos .
san francisco mayor art ag ##nos estimated that damages to the city total $ 2 billion .
many streets and sidewalks buckled , and subterranean water main ##s and service connections ru ##pt ##ured .
fe ##ma , which coordinates federal disaster relief , is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after hurricane hugo , which hit the carolina ##s last month .
white house spokesman mar ##lin fitz ##water said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements .
the bush administration has at its disposal $ 273 million in funds remaining from the $ 1 . 1 billion congress released for the cleanup after hurricane hugo .
` ` we feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate , short - term requirements , ' ' mr . fitz ##water said .
much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges .
california law ##makers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state .
the asian art museum in golden gate park reports $ 10 million to $ 15 million in damage , including shattered porcelain ##s and stone figures .

is an american secretary of state seriously suggesting that the khmer rouge should help govern cambodia ?
the aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of cambodia by allowing the khmer rouge a small share of power .
the state department says that any khmer rouge participation would have to be ` ` minimal . ' '
the usual problem with including communists in ` ` interim ' ' coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require they squeeze out everyone else .
recall that nicaragua ' s sand ##ini ##sta ##s came into mana ##gua as partners in a coalition government with anti - so ##mo ##za moderate ##s .
in laos , when the western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination .
even mao ts ##e - tung ' s china began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller , non - communist parties .
that would leave hu ##n sen and the khmer rouge .
the khmer rouge , however , carry an un ##sur ##pass ##ed record for cambodian ty ##ran ##ny .
these utopia ##ns caused the deaths - - by starvation , disease or execution - - of well over one million cambodian ##s .
the cambodian horror was so bad that the vietnamese occupation in 1978 was a per ##verse form of relief .
but there is no solid evidence that the khmer rouge have changed .
true , prince si ##han ##ouk backs the idea of such a coalition , at least for this week .
but prince si ##han ##ouk has backed all sorts of ideas over the years , and done rather better by himself than by cambodia .
nor should the u . s . worry much about off ##ending china , which still aids the khmer rouge .
it ' s time the state department recognized that china does not play by gentlemen ' s rules .
u . s . diplomacy has done it before , and it will likely do it again .
the administration and congress have lately tango ##ed around the idea of sending military aid to cambodia ' s non - communists .
at the very least , the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the khmer rouge and cambodia ' s communists from ultimately moving against their opponents .

earnings for fiscal 1989 were $ 14 . 4 million , or 80 cents a share , on sales of $ 257 . 8 million .
mr . dell attributed the earnings slide to new product delays , such as a laptop scheduled for september that wo n ' t be introduced until early november .
mr . dell , meanwhile , con ##cede ##s the company was ` ` definitely too optimistic ' ' in its expectations .
the result has been thinner margins , which have been further eroded by an ambitious research and development effort and rapid overseas expansion .

the canadian government introduced in the house of commons legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government - owned telephone utilities in alberta , saskatchewan and manitoba .
the legislation would open the way for more telephone services and more competition in the telephone business in the three provinces , federal officials said .
prior to the ruling the federal government had regulated only the telephone companies in quebec , ontario , british columbia and the northwest territories .
the governments of alberta , saskatchewan and manitoba have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies .
the extension of federal regulatory authority over telephone utilities in the atlantic provinces has n ' t required special legislation because they are investor - owned .
proceeds from those sales will be used to reduce debt .

the company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter , totaling $ 63 million , compared with $ 28 million in the third quarter .
excluding tax credits , profit was 6 % below the second quarter .
but that drop was caused entirely by a decline in brazilian interest paid , to $ 5 million from $ 54 million the second quarter .
by any measure , third - quarter earnings were still robust , equivalent to a 0 . 92 % return on assets even excluding tax credits .
but it continued to badly trail its san francisco neighbor , wells fargo & co . , which reported an extraordinary 1 . 25 % return on assets .
both returns do n ' t include any tax credits .
in composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange , bank ##ame ##rica common stock edged up 12 . 5 cents to close at $ 32 a share .

bank ##ame ##rica ' s total loans rose 8 % to $ 71 . 36 billion .
in an unusual display of open ##ness , ibm also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by ibm ' s competitors .
the industry executives said that , as usual with such broad announcements from ibm , this one will be part reality and part strategy .
also as usual , the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of ibm equipment , at least initially .
` ` this is a step in the right direction , ' ' said martin pi ##sz ##cz ##als ##ki , a yankee group analyst .
he added , though , that ` ` a lot of this is intentions . . . .
we ' ll have to wait and see ' ' how the plan develops .
the announcements also should help ibm go on the offensive against digital equipment corp . on the plant floor .
he ##wl ##ett - packard co . also has begun to gain share in the whole computer - integrated - manufacturing arena .
ibm will face an up ##hill climb against digital , given digital ' s reputation for being better than ibm at hook ##ing together different manufacturers ' computers .
that is because many companies will standard ##ize on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge , and ibm is the biggest player .
but much will depend on how quickly ibm can move .
but he said a system such as ibm ' s should help significantly .
that can be expensive , because the problem may not be noticed for a while , and the sheets are typically thrown away .
but mr . keller said that , if computers can be integrated into the process , they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred .
they could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of poly ##eth ##yle ##ne .
the computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled , eliminating waste .
this sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies .
companies might be able to tell sales ##pe ##ople daily , for instance , about idle equipment , so they could offer discount ##s on whatever that equipment produces .
it will continue to be sold in the european market .
this fall , ford introduced only one new product : a rest ##yle ##d version of its hulk ##ing lincoln town car luxury model .
total mer ##kur sales for the first nine months dropped 46 % from a year ago to just 6 , 320 cars .
mer ##kur is n ' t the only european luxury brand having problems in the u . s . .
the japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly overs ##had ##owing such european makes as audi and sa ##ab , which at least have clear brand images .
the first mer ##kur , the x ##r ##4 ##ti , went on sale in early 1985 .
the sport ##y coupe founder ##ed in part because american buyers did n ' t go for the car ' s unusual double - wing rear spoil ##er .
in may 1987 , ford began import ##ing the sc ##or ##pio sedan from west germany to sell next to a redesigned x ##r ##4 ##ti in show ##rooms .
one major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark , which began less than a year after mer ##kur ' s 1985 launch .
as the west german currency rose , so did mer ##kur prices .
the mer ##kur cars also suffered from spot ##ty quality , some dealers say .
but by the third quarter of 1988 , sc ##or ##pio ##s had a high satisfaction rating in internal ford studies , a spokesman said .
apparently , however , the improvement came too late .
ford said then it would keep the sc ##or ##pio .
soo line said its board appointed a special committee of independent directors to study the proposal .
the troubled minneapolis - based railroad concern said the committee has the authority to hire financial and legal advisers to assist it .
the proposed acquisition will be subject to approval by the interstate commerce commission , soo line said .
canadian pacific put its 56 % stake in soo line up for sale last year but could n ' t find any take ##rs .
canadian pacific , which has interests in transportation , telecommunications , forest products , energy and real estate , finally took its majority block off the market this spring .
canadian pacific is soo line ' s biggest customer and has owned a majority stake in the u . s . railroad since 1947 .

an additional 299 , 000 shares are authorized for rep ##ur ##chase under an earlier stock buy - back program .

but few knew it then and most still think all pencil ##s are wooden .
pencil push ##ers chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencil ##s made of glued strips of california incense cedar filled with ceramic lead .

automated machines coe ##xt ##rud ##e long plastic sheath ##s with graph ##ite - plastic cores that are printed , cut , painted and erase ##r - fitted .
eagle ' s plastic type sharpe ##ns and looks like a wooden pencil .
a major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a sl ##iver ##ed break while a plastic model will break clean ##ly .
artists and drafts ##men need harder ` ` leads . ' '
it ' s a trade secret how many were plastic , and most writers still do n ' t know what they ' re using .
pre ##ta ##x earnings declined 1 . 3 % .
the company said the decline was at ##tri ##bu ##table to a 79 % reduction in net gains on loan sales this year .

great western , based in beverly hills , cal ##if . , is a financial services firm and parent to great western bank , an s & l .
great western said it had a sharp increase in margins in the recent third quarter .
margins are the difference between the yield on the company ' s earning assets and its own cost of funds .
dun & brad ##st ##ree ##t corp . posted a 15 % rise in third - quarter earnings .
the information company also cited the stronger dollar , the sale last year of its former official airline guides unit and other factors .
revenue fell to $ 1 . 04 billion from $ 1 . 07 billion .
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , dun & brad ##st ##ree ##t closed yesterday at $ 53 . 75 , down 25 cents a share .
analysts said the results were as expected , but several added that the earnings masked underlying weaknesses in several businesses .
dun & brad ##st ##ree ##t said operating earnings rose 8 % , excluding the sale of official airline guides .
the company has denied the allegations but has negotiated a proposed $ 18 million settlement of related lawsuits .
dun & brad ##st ##ree ##t noted that price competition in its nielsen marketing research , nielsen clearing house and donnell ##ey marketing businesses also restrained revenue growth .
it cited cyclic ##al conditions in its moody ' s investors service inc . and d & b plan services units .
year - earlier earnings reflected costs of $ 14 . 3 million related to the acquisition of im ##s international .
revenue rose slightly to $ 3 . 16 billion from $ 3 . 13 billion .
control data corp . said it licensed its airline yield - management software to the international air transport association .
terms include a royalty arrangement , but details were n ' t disclosed .
the computer equipment and financial services company said iata , a trade group , will sell access to the package to its 180 airline members world - wide .
control data will receive revenue linked to the number of passengers served by the software , iata said .
the time schedule for installing the equipment also will be developed by the task force , the company said .

in the long , frightening night after tuesday ' s devastating earthquake , bay area residents searched for comfort and sol ##ace wherever they could .
some found it on the screen of a personal computer .
about two - thirds of the well ' s 3 , 000 subscribers live in the bay area .
the quake knocked the well out for six hours , but when it came back up , it tee ##med with emotional first - hand reports .
following are excerpts from the electronic traffic that night .
the time is pacific daylight time , and the initials or nickname ##s are those subscribers use to identify themselves .
got back to bo ##lina ##s , and everything had fallen : broken poster frames with glass on the floor , file cabinets open or dumped onto the floor .
i was in my favorite watering hole , waiting for the game to start .
that ' s usually how long it takes for the te ##mb ##lor ##s to pass .
i was in the berkeley main library when it hit .
endless seconds wondering if those huge windows would buckle and shower us with glass .
only a few books fell in the reading room .
then the auto paint shop fire sent an evil - looking cloud of black smoke into the air .
this building shook like hell and it kept getting stronger .
except for the gas tank at hu ##stead ' s towing service exploding and burning in downtown berkeley , things here are quite peaceful .
huge fire from broken gas main in the marina in sf .
areas that are made of ` fill ' li ##que ##fy .
a woman in a three - story apartment was able to walk out the window of the third floor onto street level after the quake .
the house just settled right down into the ground .
worst part was watching power lines waving above my head and no way to drive away .
was 300 ft . out on a pier in san rafael .
many hair ##line cracks in the concrete slabs afterwards .
i rode it out on the second floor of leo ' s at 55th and telegraph in oakland .
i heard parts of the building above my head cracking .
i could n ' t decide if i should come home to marin , because my house is on stil ##ts .
there was a horrible smell of gas as i passed the che ##vron refinery before crossing the richmond - san rafael bridge .
i could also see the clouds across the bay from the horrible fire in the marina district of san francisco .
my back is still in knots and my hands are still shaking .
i think a few of the after ##sho ##cks might just be my body shaking .
i could see the flames from san francisco from my house across the bay .
it ' s hard to believe this really is happening .
building on the corner severely damaged , so an old lady and her very old mother are in the guest room .
bo ##lina ##s - - astrid ##e the san andreas fault .
did n ' t feel a thing , but noticed some strange bird behavior .
i just felt another after ##sho ##ck a few seconds ago .
downtown bo ##lina ##s seems to be the part of town that ' s worst off .
it runs out frantically now and then , and is clearly pretty distressed .
i was in st ##ins ##on beach when the quake rolled through town .
amazing what it does to one ' s heart rate and one ' s short - term memory .
everyone looked calm , but there was this surreal low level of confusion as the after ##sho ##cks continued .
a friend of mine was in an underground computer center in downtown sf when the quake hit .
he said that one of the computers took a three - foot trip sliding across the floor .
today should be interesting as people realize how hard life is going to be here for a while .
i got home , let the dogs into the house and noticed some sounds above my head , as if someone were walking on the roof , or upstairs .
then i noticed the car was bouncing up and down as if someone were jumping on it .
i realized what was happening and screamed into the house for the dogs .
never in my life have i been so frightened .
when i saw the pictures of 880 and the bay bridge , i began to cry .
i was just sitting down to meet with some new therapy clients , a couple , and the building started shaking like crazy .
it ' s a fl ##im ##sy structure , built up on supports , and it was really rocking around .
the three of us stopped breathing for a moment , and then when it kept on coming we lunged for the doorway .
needles ##s to say , it was an interesting first session !
biggest trouble was scared family who could n ' t get a phone line through , and spent a really horrible hour not knowing .
judy and i were in our back yard when the lawn started rolling like ocean waves .
we are all fine here , although ma ##me was extremely freaked .
not one thing in the house is where it is supposed to be , but the structure is fine .
it ' s amazing how one second can so completely change your life .
i guess we ' re all living very tentatively here , waiting for the expected but dread ##ed after ##sho ##ck .
it ' s hard to accept that it ' s over and only took 15 seconds .
i wonder when we ' ll be able to relax .
flesh goes to total alert for flight or fight .
i walked along sha ##tt ##uck between delaware and cedar at a few minutes before eight this morning .
sales increased 10 % to $ 2 . 65 billion from $ 2 . 41 billion .
with strong prices in the company ' s two major areas - - building products as well as pulp and paper - - analysts had expected a roaring quarter .
but the performance exceeded some estimates of around $ 1 . 90 a share .
fuel ##ing the growth , among other things , were higher - than - expected prices for certain building products .
one reason : efforts to protect the spotted owl led to restrictions on logging in the pacific northwest , con ##st ##ricting supply and forcing prices up .
another reason : strikes , both at georgia - pacific and other lumber companies also cut supplies and raised prices , analysts said .

the 23 - 5 vote clears the way for consideration on the house floor next week or the week after .
transportation secretary samuel skinner , in a letter to the committee , warned that he would urge president bush to veto the legislation if it passed congress .
the senate commerce committee already has approved similar legislation .
the stepped - up administration warnings annoyed some law ##makers , especially senior republicans who supported the bill because they thought the transportation department favored it .
but he never took an official position on the bill and has ste ##ad ##fast ##ly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy - outs .
although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline , it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt .
supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt .
the panel ' s action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy - out proposals , their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market .
but mr . skinner disagreed , calling the legislation ` ` a retreat from the policy of der ##eg ##ula ##ton of the airline industry . ' '
currently , the transportation department does n ' t have the authority to block a takeover in advance .
however , if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate , the department may rev ##oke its certificate , ground ##ing the airline .
such authority is more than adequate , say opponents of the legislation .
but supporters argue that ground ##ing an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate doing it .
london shares rallied to post strong gains after initial fears eva ##por ##ated that the california earthquake would de ##press wall street prices .
tokyo stocks , which rebound ##ed strongly tuesday , extended their gains yesterday , but most other asian and pacific markets closed sharply lower .

the financial times 30 - share index settled 27 . 8 points higher at 1758 . 5 .
volume was 44 ##9 . 3 million shares , the slow ##est of a he ##ctic week , compared with 64 ##3 . 4 million tuesday .
but technical factors , including modest gains in the value of the pound , helped draw buying back into the market and reverse losses posted a day earlier .

in early trading in tokyo thursday , the nik ##kei index rose 135 . 09 points to 352 ##42 . 65 .
institutions , meanwhile , stepped back to the side ##lines as the direction of u . s . interest rates remained unclear .
traders and analysts said they did n ' t see any effect on tokyo stocks from the california earthquake .
the impact on japanese ins ##urer ##s and property owners with interests in the san francisco area is still being assessed , they said .
buying was scattered across a wide range of issues , making the session fairly character ##less , traders said .
with uncertainty still hanging over interest rates and the dollar , the market failed to find a focus that might lead to further investor commitments , they said .
some traders said the popularity of issues that gained yesterday wo n ' t last long , as investors will rotate their buying choices over the short term .
interest rate - sensitive shares such as steel , construction and electric utility companies , which rose early in the week , saw their advance weaken yesterday .
traders said these issues need large - volume buying to push up their prices , so substantial gains are n ' t likely unless institutional investors participate .
some la ##gga ##rd food issues attracted bargain - hunters , traders said .
ki ##rin brewery was up 100 at 2 , 000 , and aj ##ino ##moto gained 70 to 2 , 840 .

housing construction sank in september to its lowest level since the last recession , the commerce department reported .
originally the department had reported the august decline as 5 % .
the numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the federal reserve ' s battle against inflation .
sales of new homes rose and inventor ##ies of houses , which had been climbing , dropped .
but last month new construction in all types of homes wan ##ed , from single - family houses to large apartment complexes .
` ` it ' s pretty much weak across the board , ' ' said martin regal ##ia , chief economist of the national council of savings institutions .
another reason for the weakness , he said , may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began ed ##ging down after a peak in march .
in august , rates on 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage ##s started creeping up a bit , but they inched down again through september .
` ` rates have n ' t really peeled off that much , ' ' mr . regal ##ia said .
` ` we ' ve kind of settled now into an interest - rate environment that ' s fairly high . ' '
that followed a 3 . 3 % decline in august .
all the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal variations in building activity .

in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , shear ##son shares lost 37 . 5 cents to $ 18 . 125 .
the company said the improved performance from a year ago reflects higher commissions and revenue from market ##making and trading for its own account .
commission revenue was $ 52 ##2 million , up 49 % .
but industry ##wide trading activity slowed in september as institutional investors turned cautious and individuals continued to shy away from the market .
investment banking revenue fell 32 % to $ 205 million , in part reflecting the continued slow ##down of the under ##writing business .

now , mr . guzman cab ##rera is facing accusations that he ' s as much a company man as la qui ##na was a crook .
mr . guzman cab ##rera ' s new order has n ' t arrived without resistance .
brawl ##s between union factions still er ##upt at pe ##me ##x installations .
the 61 - year - old mr . guzman cab ##rera takes such criticisms in stride .
` ` this is n ' t a new kind of union leadership , it ' s a new mexico .
we ' re no longer afraid of ass ##oc ##iating with private or foreign capital , ' ' he says .
pe ##me ##x , which produces 40 % of government revenue , desperately needs new investment .
little money has been returned to upgrade pe ##me ##x ' s aging facilities .
while the government drains pe ##me ##x from above , the union has drained it from below .
the declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why mexico has been import ##ing gasoline this year .
some projections show mexico import ##ing crude by the end of the century , barr ##ing an overhaul of operations .

` ` i ' m the secretary - general , if there is one , ' ' he says , greeting a visitor to his office .
though he also long benefited from the system built by la qui ##na , mr . guzman cab ##rera says union per ##ks had simply gotten out of hand .
they are ` ` at the base of all of the problems of corruption , ' ' he says .

about 9 , 800 technical workers , notably chemist ##s and lawyers , were switched to non - union status .
mr . guzman cab ##rera says the union ' s sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22 % increase in compensation .
but pe ##me ##x managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract .
` ` we are re ##taking the instruments of administration , ' ' says raul rob ##les , a pe ##me ##x sub ##di ##re ##ctor .
pe ##me ##x ' s customers also are pleased with the company ' s new spirit .
grupo des ##c , a big conglomerate , has long depended on pe ##me ##x pet ##ro ##chemical ##s to produce plastic packing material .
but when the pe ##me ##x plant shut down for an annual overhaul , it would never give notice to its customers .
` ` the cap ##ric ##ious ##ness would completely disrupt our operations , ' ' says ernesto vega ve ##las ##co , des ##c ' s finance director .
later , the government rec ##lassified several basic pet ##ro ##chemical ##s as secondary products .
` ` they are preparing the workers for what ' s coming : foreign control , ' ' wrote he ##berto castillo , a leftist leader .
mr . guzman cab ##rera and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products .
but the new union leader makes no apologies for pe ##me ##x ' s more outward - looking attitude .
more executives and their spouse ##s are seeking counseling as work and family pressures mount .
some employers initiate refer ##ral ##s , especially if work problems threaten a top manager ' s job .
employers foot the bill , he says , figuring what ' s good for the couple is good for the company .
one east coast manufacturing executive , faced with a job transfer his wife resented , found that counseling helped them both come to grips with the move .
more dual - career couples also are getting help , with men increasingly bringing their working wives for joint counseling .
` ` putting those times on the calendar , ' ' she says , ` ` is as important as remembering business appointments . ' '

ua ##l management was to pay $ 15 million for 10 % , and british air was to receive a 15 % stake .
the buy - out fell through when ci ##tic ##or ##p and chase manhattan corp . unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing .

mr . stevens said he expects the new price will be considerably lower , but declined to specify a figure .

the federal reserve system is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes , for two reasons .
first , its position in the government is an ##oma ##lous .
thus we have a condition that is easily described as und ##em ##oc ##ratic .
as former fed chairman william mcc ##hes ##ney martin used to say , they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting .
so the federal reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians .
some of these ideas are again under consideration in congress .
but these proposals do not rest on a view of what the fed ' s problem is or , if they do , they rest on an incorrect view .
they would not solve the problem ; they would make it worse .
the problem is not that the fed is too un ##res ##pon ##sive to the public interest .
on the contrary , it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest .
the price level in the u . s . is now about 4 1 \ / 4 times as high as it was 30 years ago .
on average , something that cost $ 100 30 years ago now costs $ 425 .
or , a wage that was $ 100 30 years ago would buy only $ 23 . 53 worth of stuff today .
on two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10 % a year .
in each case the ending of this un ##sus ##tain ##able inflation caused a severe recession - - the two worst of the postwar period .
the enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy .
and that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the federal reserve .
the basic problem of monetary policy , to which reform of the fed should be addressed , is to prevent a rec ##ur ##rence of this experience .
there were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years :
1 . to some extent the federal reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansion ##ary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output .
2 . even where the fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it .
despite all the formal provisions for its independence , the fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it .
the common proposals for reforming the fed would only make the situation worse , if they had any effect at all .
putting the secretary of the treasury on the board of governors , one of the leading proposals today , is an example .
the secretary is the world ' s biggest borrow ##er of money .
he has a built - in , constant longing for lower interest rates .
how should a reasonable member of the federal reserve board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board ?
could he pl ##aus ##ibly interpret it as encouragement for the fed to give primary emphasis to stab ##ili ##zing the price level ?
- l ##rb - true , a succession of fed chair ##men has given color to the notion that the secretary of the treasury belongs on the fed .
the fed ' s problem is not that it is too independent , or too un ##pol ##itical .
the fed is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more over ##tly political part of the government .
the fed exercises a power given to it by congress and the president .
but congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the fed .
critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is und ##em ##oc ##ratic .
to leave this decision to an ` ` independent ' ' agency is not only und ##em ##oc ##ratic .
the greatest contribution congress could make at this time would be to declare that stab ##ili ##zing the price level is the primary responsibility of the federal reserve system .
it is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted , however .
people will say that the nation and the government have other objectives , in addition to stab ##ili ##zing the price level , which is true .
but that is not the same as saying that the federal reserve has other objectives .
the government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives .
but it has only the fed to pursue price - level stability .
and the fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stab ##ili ##zing the price level .
the two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the fed are high employment and rapid real growth .

bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the san francisco bay area for months to come .
getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem , however .
` ` people ' s ability to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted , ' ' said a spokesman for the american automobile association .
` ` some foods ##tu ##ff shipments will probably resume thursday , ' ' he said .
` ` right now most of the roads into the bay area are closed , but the list of closing ##s changes about every 20 minutes .
united parcel service , greenwich , con ##n . , said its operations in the san francisco area have been reduced to 40 % of normal .
the spokesman noted four - hour to five - hour traffic delays on the san mateo bridge , for example .
in addition , power failures prevented its package - sorting facilities from operating , causing delays .
but freight railroads reported that damage to their facilities was relatively minor , with santa fe pacific corp . ' s rail unit the least affected by the quake .
santa fe stopped freight trains tuesday night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at 10 : 45 p . m . when they found no damage .
union pacific corp . ' s rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its oakland yard , its track , bridges and structures were unharmed .
that railroad is operating trains but with delays caused by employees unable to get to work .
but service on the line is expected to resume by noon today .
` ` we had no serious damage on the railroad , ' ' said a southern pacific spokesman .
` ` we have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down . ' '
amtrak said it suspended train service into its oakland station , which sustained ` ` heavy structural damage ' ' during the quake .
the passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in sacramento , relying on buses to ferry passengers to the bay area .
amtrak said it planned to resume some train operations to oakland late yesterday .
rail - transit operations suffered little damage , according to albert eng ##el ##ken , deputy executive director of the american public transit association in washington .
` ` the highway system is screwed up ' ' by the earthquake , mr . eng ##el ##ken said .
` ` the transit system is how people are going to be getting around . ' '
he added that san francisco ' s trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels .
although air - traffic delays in san francisco were significant yesterday , they did n ' t appear to spread to other airports .
terminals at san francisco international also were damaged , but the tower itself was intact .
tuesday night , thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel .
the airports in san jose and oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday , the federal aviation administration said .
` ` i think that ' s the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from japan to land here , ' ' an airport spokesman said .
a japan air lines spokesman said its flights into and out of san francisco were n ' t affected , but getting information about its operations was difficult .
its telecommunications headquarters in bu ##rling ##ame , cal ##if . , had been knocked out since the quake .

w ##hit ##bread & co . put its spirits division up for sale , triggering a scramble among global groups for the british company ' s brands .
beef ##ea ##ter alone is worth as much as # 300 million , analysts said .
w ##hit ##bread bought the beef ##ea ##ter distillery two years ago for # 174 . 5 million .
that purchase represented an attempt by w ##hit ##bread , a venerable british brewer , to become a major player in the global liquor business .
but w ##hit ##bread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry .
now , it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations .
for rival liquor companies , the w ##hit ##bread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands .
` ` the division will be sold off quite rapidly , ' ' predicted neill juno ##r , an analyst at london broker ##s county nat ##west wood ##mac .
among possible buyers , grand metropolitan plc might find beef ##ea ##ter a useful addition to its portfolio .
two other global liquor giants , canada ' s sea ##gram co . and britain ' s allied - lyons plc , also are possible buyers .
allied - lyons , while powerful in whiskey , does n ' t own any major white - spirit brands .
` ` we will certainly have to take a look at ' ' the w ##hit ##bread spirits business , an allied - lyons spokesman said .
` ` we would certainly like to have a major white - spirits brand in our portfolio . ' '
a sea ##gram spokesman in new york would n ' t comment .
such companies ` ` are increasingly being left behind ' ' in the global liquor business , says no ##mura ' s mr . little ##boy .

brown - form ##an , a louisville , ky . di ##sti ##ller , also declined to comment .
but analysts estimate their trading profit at # 30 million .
w ##hit ##bread ' s spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shake ##up in the british beer industry .
earlier this year , the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry .
british brewers currently own thousands of pubs , which in turn sell only the brewer ##ies ' beer and soft drinks .
under new rules , many of the country ' s pubs would become ` ` free houses , ' ' selling beers of their choice .
w ##hit ##bread now intends to bo ##lster its brewing interests , in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses .
w ##hit ##bread also owns the license to brew and distribute he ##ine ##ken and stella art ##ois beers in britain .
in addition , w ##hit ##bread intends to focus on its newer hotel , liquor store and restaurant businesses in europe and north america .
in britain , those interests include the beef ##ea ##ter steak ##house chain and joint ownership with pepsi ##co inc . of the country ' s pizza hut chain .
in canada and the u . s . , w ##hit ##bread owns the ke ##g chain of steak and seafood restaurants .
the spirits business ` ` would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players . ' '
w ##hit ##bread also announced that mr . jarvis , who is 48 , will become the company ' s chief executive march 1 .
at that time sam w ##hit ##bread , the company ' s chairman and a descendant of its 18th - century founder , will retire from executive duties .
he will retain the honorary title of non - executive chairman .
the offering will be dated oct . 31 and mature oct . 31 ,

ibm , based in arm ##on ##k , n . y . , has dominated the market for decades .
ibm appears more worried about digital , which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line , dubbed the va ##x 900 ##0 .
` ` it ' s going to be nuclear war , ' ' says thomas will ##mot ##t , a consultant with aberdeen group inc .
the surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge main ##frame market , where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years .
ibm ' s traditional main ##frame rivals , including un ##is ##ys corp . , control data corp . and nc ##r corp . , have struggled recently .
and unlike ibm ' s water - cooled main ##frame ##s , it does n ' t need any plumbing .
the challenger ##s will have a big price advantage .
digital is expected to tag its new line from about $ 1 . 24 million to $ 4 . 4 million and up , depending on configuration .
that ' s about half the price of com ##para ##bly equipped ibm main ##frame ##s .
the heightened competition will hit ibm at a difficult time .
the computer giant ' s current main ##frame line , which has sold well and has huge profit margins , is starting to show its age .
the new 309 ##0s due next week will boost performance by only about 8 % to 10 % .
and ibm is n ' t expected to deliver a new generation of main ##frame ##s until 1991 .
still , no one expects ibm ' s rivals to deliver a knockout .
ibm has a near - monopoly on main ##frame ##s , with an estimated 70 % share of the market .
ibm is five times the size of digital - - and 40 times the size of tandem - - and wi ##eld ##s enormous market power .
it counts among its customers a majority of the world ' s largest corporations , which en ##trust their most critical business information to ibm computers .
tandem , which already specializes in on - line transaction processing , is a potent competitor in that market .
a key marketing target for digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both digital and ibm systems .
the software conversion costs would dwarf any savings . ' '
but mr . rose is still looking seriously at the 900 ##0 .
as that system grows , larger computers may be needed .
` ` in the past , customers had to go to ibm when they out ##gre ##w the va ##x .
now they do n ' t have to , ' ' he says .
` ` that ' s going to cost ibm revenue . ' '
analysts say digital can expect this pen ##t - up demand for the new va ##x to fuel strong sales next year .
he bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of digital ' s largest customers .
although digital will announce a full family of main ##frame ##s next week , it is n ' t expected to begin shipping in volume until next year .
four more models , aimed square ##ly at ibm ' s commercial customers , are expected to begin shipping in late june .
most analysts do n ' t expect the new main ##frame ##s to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter , which begins next july 1 .
digital ' s new line has been a long time coming .
ibm will face still more competition in coming months .

as you mentioned , subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curt ##ailed in 1982 by the coastal barrier resource system .
this bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support .
private - property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development .
however , home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach - house construction .
a taxpayers union study concluded the bill would save taxpayers up to $ 9 . 3 billion in barrier - island subsidies over 20 years .
already , the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated $ 800 million .
the government said 13 . 1 % of americans , or 31 . 9 million people , were living in poverty in 1988 .

there was no reversal - lc ##b - of that trend - rc ##b - between 1987 and 1988 . ' '
but the median income of american families fell 0 . 2 % , the first time it has failed to rise since 1982 .
poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other americans .
in 1988 , 31 . 6 % of blacks lived in poverty , compared with 10 . 1 % for whites and 26 . 8 % for hispanic ##s .
but two - thirds of all poor americans were white .
more than half of poor families were headed by women living without men , the bureau said .
more than three - fourth ##s of poor black families were headed by women .
the rate among the elderly - - 12 % in 1988 - - was n ' t significantly lower than the year before .
that is the greatest share reported for any year since 1950 , although changing definitions over the years di ##stor ##t the comparison .
- - the top fifth of all families got 44 % of the income , up from 41 . 5 % a decade earlier .
the bottom fifth of all families got 4 . 6 % of the income , down from 5 . 2 % a decade earlier .
it rose sharply in the northeast and midwest and fell slightly in the south and west .
median family income was $ 32 , 191 , down 0 . 2 % .

at the end of the term of the convertible loan , sears could still own half the building , and ae ##w could own the other half .
the new manager will face the da ##unt ##ing task of leasing 1 . 8 million square feet in a relatively soft chicago real estate market .
also , it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage ae ##w will be able to convert into equity .
convertible mortgage ##s have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late .
during the term , the lend ##er can either receive a percentage of cash flow , a percentage of the building ' s appreciation or a fixed return .
the main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and re ##app ##rai ##sal .
sears said it would put the 110 - story tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti - takeover restructuring .
but japanese institutions shi ##ed away from bidding on the high - profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti - japanese sentiment .
last summer , sears appeared to have a deal with canadian developer olympia & york developments ltd .
real estate industry executives said sears ' investment banker , goldman , sachs & co . , sought financing in japan .
however , japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a ref ##ina ##nc ##ing also would attract too much publicity .
sears then went back to ae ##w , the boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring .
ae ##w has $ 3 . 5 billion of real estate investments nationwide , according to a spokesman .
tan ##dy corp . said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of data ##tron ##ic ab of stockholm for cash .
in addition , tan ##dy will acquire rights to the victor and micro ##nic names for computers .
during 1988 , the data ##tron ##ic subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of $ 200 million .
closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approval ##s , the company said .
two rules in pending congressional legislation threaten to hind ##er leverage ##d buy - outs by raising the price tags of such deals by as much as 10 % .
wall street is see ##thing over the rules , which would curt ##ail the tax de ##du ##ct ##ibility of debt used in most lb ##os .
indeed , some investment bankers have already started restructuring deals to cope with the expected rules .
wall street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less one ##rous senate version of one of the provisions .
at issue is the de ##du ##ct ##ibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most lb ##os .
under current rules , that acc ##rued interest is de ##du ##ct ##ible by the company issuing the debt .
the house version of the legislation would kill that de ##duction , and label any such debt as equity , which is n ' t de ##du ##ct ##ible .
the less - rigorous senate version would def ##er the de ##du ##ct ##ibility for roughly five years .
typically , mr . will ##ens estimates , this type of debt makes up 15 % to 20 % of the financing for lb ##os .
but that rule is being virtually overlooked by wall street , which is concentrating on coping with the de ##duction issue .
several wall street officials say the proposed legislation already is having an impact .
` ` we would have paid more if we thought that law was n ' t going to pass , ' ' he said .
that would force the buy - out firm and the target company ' s management to reduce their level of ownership .
another solution , said a tax lawyer who requested an ##ony ##mity , is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount .
since they have a lower interest rate , they would n ' t fall under the junk - bond category that would lose its de ##du ##ct ##ibility .
the bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n ' t de ##du ##ct ##ible .
the senate bill would only deny the de ##duction until interest is actually paid .
currently , even though the issue ##r does n ' t pay tax , the debt holder is tax ##ed on the acc ##rued interest .
but those holders are often foreign investors and tax - exempt pension funds that do n ' t pay taxes on their holdings .
the senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield $ 17 million the first year and a total of $ 40 ##9 million over five years .
even if wall street finds ways around the new rules , a senate aide contend ##s lb ##os will become somewhat more difficult .
` ` there ' s no question it will make lb ##os more expensive , ' ' he said .
` ` the interest de ##duction was the engine that made these things more productive .
the firm said that losers outnumbered gain ##ers by more than three to one among the 122 funds it tracks .
for the first nine months of the year , norwood said the average fund has lost 3 . 3 % .
president bush signed a disaster declaration covering seven northern california counties .
the declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing , grants and low - cost loans to cover un ##ins ##ured property losses .
in addition , an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance .
now , though , enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief .
the federal government is n ' t even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it .
in congress , law ##makers already are looking for ways to add relief funds .
money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the federal emergency management agency , which coordinates federal disaster relief .
more likely , relief funds could be added to an omnibus spending bill that congress is to begin considering next week .
but it is n ' t just washington ' s relief dollars that are spread thin ; its relief manpower also is stretched .
mr . clan ##aha ##n says fe ##ma now possibly may have the heaviest case ##load in its history .
to further com ##pl ##icate relief efforts , the privately funded american red cross also finds itself strapped for funds after its big hugo operation .
` ` it just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget . ' '
the red cross has opened 30 shelters in the bay area , serving 5 , 000 people .
twenty - five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states .
still , some aid is moving westward from washington almost immediately .
another federal agency not normally associated with disaster relief - - the internal revenue service - - moved quickly as well .
the irs said it will wai ##ve certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadline ##s or make payments because of the quake ' s devastation .
the agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days .
by yesterday afternoon , air force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies , physicians , communications equipment and fe ##ma personnel to california .
a military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior bush administration officials to survey the damage .
and the pentagon said dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert ` ` awaiting orders to move emergency supplies . ' '
two air force facilities near sacramento , and travis air force base , 50 miles northeast of san francisco , were designated to serve as medical - airlift centers .
some victims also were treated at the letterman army medical center in san francisco and at the naval hospital in oakland .
and federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal highway aid to rebuild the area ' s severely damaged road system .
the federal highway administration has an emergency relief program to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters .
to get that money , states must go through an elaborate approval process , but officials expect red tape to be cut this time .
the first phase of the program has been completed , but two other phases are continuing .

michael maynard offered the world a faster way to break eggs .
as thanks , the egg industry tried to break him .
and the egg producers have done a pretty good job .
they tried to put mr . maynard out of business by an act of congress .
egg - industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban mr . maynard ' s automatic egg - breaking machine because of fears over salmon ##ella .
his company , mis ##a manufacturing inc . , was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquid ##ated .
mr . maynard is n ' t the first entrepreneur to bump up against en ##tre ##nched interests .
now one might ask why people who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them .
part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry .
but for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day , breaking them by hand can get , well , out of hand .
such cent ##ri ##fu ##gal egg breakers have been around since the 1890s .
but when mr . maynard came forward with his machine in the early 1970s nobody else was offering them in the u . s . .
chickens carry this bacteria , which can cause upset stomach ##s and , in rare cases , death among people .
hen ##s sometimes pass salmon ##ella to the eggs , and it can also be found on uncle ##an shells .
thus , any machine that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmon ##ella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones .
mr . maynard claims this is a manage ##able problem .
with nearly 4 , 000 machines in use , there have been no salmon ##ella problems as long as instructions were followed , mr . maynard boasts .
he says the handful of salmon ##ella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an egg king stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products .
but he says that ' s no more a reason for banning egg kings than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars .
leading the assault against the egg king has been united egg producers .
an early battle ##ground was the u . s . department of agriculture .
mr . maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg - processing facilities regulated by the usd ##a ' s food safety inspection service .
unfortunately for mr . maynard , another branch of the usd ##a , the agricultural marketing service , was in charge of eggs .
the egg producers also lobbied the food and drug administration .
so the producers went to capitol hill , where a congressman from georgia introduced a measure to ban cent ##ri ##fu ##gal egg - breaking machines .
mr . maynard , whose company at the time was based in santa ana , cal ##if . , enlisted his local congressman , and the battle was joined .
mr . maynard ' s forces finally defeated the measure , though it took a vote on the floor of the house of representatives to do it .
even then , opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an ` ` un ##sc ##rup ##ulous ' ' method for breaking eggs .
foil ##ed in their effort to get a national ban , the egg producers turned their attention to the states .
so far , new york , new jersey , nebraska , georgia , michigan and minnesota have outlawed mr . maynard ' s device , citing health concerns .
the judge dismissed the suit and ordered mr . maynard ' s company to pay over $ 100 , 000 in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers .
mr . maynard says the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court .
now he has moved to oklahoma where costs are lower , and started a new company , ads ##i inc . , to market his machine .
but , so far , the change of scenery has n ' t ended his string of bad breaks .
mr . maynard recently fell from a horse and fractured his arm .

money - market mutual fund assets grew at nearly three times their usual rate in the latest week , as investors opted for safety instead of the stock market .

mat ##urities usually are shorter when rates are rising and longer when they are falling .
the average maturity of the funds tracked by ib ##c \ / don ##og ##hue ' s remained at 38 days for the third consecutive week .
it was as short as 29 days at the start of this year , when rates were marching steadily upward , and hit 42 days in august .
the average seven - day simple yield of the funds fell to 8 . 21 % this week from 8 . 26 % .
some funds are posting yields far higher than the average .
the highest yielding taxa ##ble fund this week was harbor money market fund , with a seven - day compound yield of 12 . 75 % .
that included capital gains that were passed along to customers .
among the other high - yielding funds , fidelity ' s spartan fund had a seven - day compound yield of 9 . 33 % in the latest week .

cracking the top 10 within three years will be difficult at best .
della fe ##mina had billings of just $ 660 million last year and ranked as the u . s . ' s 24th - largest ad agency .
the merged agency ' s game plan to attract multinational packaged - goods ad ##vert ##iser ##s may prove equally difficult .
still , the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media - buying firms that europe has seen .

one of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic turks out of bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention .
today ' s turks in bulgaria , in other words , deserve what is coming to them four centuries later .
as if this were n ' t enough , the senate judiciary committee is getting into the act .
there can be no qui ##bbling that the armenians endured terrible suffering , but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve .
turkey has been fighting its past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful .
must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blame ##s it for the genocide of another people ?
such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward turkey that surfaced when turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its bulgarian emigration crisis .
mr . do ##le ' s odd effort notwithstanding , most of turkey ' s political problems lie with the europeans .
part of the problem some europeans have with turkey seems to stem from its location - - turkey is n ' t really part of europe .
why , they wonder , should it belong to the ec ?
no one has to accept the sins of the ottoman empire to reject that argument .
the country has in recent years accepted more than 500 , 000 refugees from at least four bordering nations .
now it is their fellow turks arriving as refugees from bulgaria .
the turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttle ##d off to that notorious dust ##bin of history that has become so convenient recently .
surely , the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten .

the single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the spec ##ter of drugs out of their neighborhoods .
if that takes money , take it away from this disc ##red ##ited federal department .
but of course the democrats pill ##ory ##ing hu ##d in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind .
instead , they ' re scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the hu ##d scandal .
this month , hu ##d secretary jack kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at hu ##d .
no doubt many of his ideas are worthy , but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently .
last week , secretary kemp ran into a buzz ##sa ##w of criticism from house banking committee members .
these development grants mainly en ##rich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garage ##s .
they also give those in congress political credit for bringing home the pork , and so they are popular with such members as mary rose oak ##ar .
she says it ' d create 600 jobs and bring cleveland tourist revenue .
rep . chalmers wylie , an ohio republican , rallied to the cause : ` ` i think the gentle ##lad ##y is making an important statement .
the implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there ' s something wrong , i think is most unfortunate . ' '
our view is that given congress ' s attitude toward hu ##d , the place probably is beyond reform .
for more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities .
in the process hu ##d has wasted unto ##ld billions , created sl ##ums and invited corruption .
much of hu ##d ' s spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class .
selling the f ##ha ' s loan portfolio to the highest bid ##der would save the taxpayers unto ##ld billions in future losses .
the rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the ne ##igh ##bh ##or ##hood ##s .
a man in a wheelchair was gunn ##ed down in the cross ##fire of a miami drug battle .
a three - year - old brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer .
decent life in the inner cities wo n ' t be restored unless the government reclaim ##s the streets from the drug gangs .
until then , the billions hu ##d spends on inner - city housing simply is wasted .
it ' s still unclear whether secretary kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at hu ##d or just tighten a few screw ##s here and there .
no doubt he believes the place can be salvage ##d .
having seen the h ##yp ##oc ##ris ##y with which congress has addressed the hu ##d scandals , we disagree .
it ' s time to scrap the politically in ##fest ##ed spending machine hu ##d has become and channel the resources into the drug war .

the rubble after the armenian earthquake a year ago disclosed , quite literally , a city whose larger structures had been built with sand .
the extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chi ##can ##ery and bureau ##cratic indifference .
the larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of san francisco is surely with the state of the u . s . economy .
did the stock - market tremor ##s of friday , oct . 13 , pre ##sa ##ge larger fra ##gil ##ity , far greater up ##hea ##val ##s ?
are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the spans of the bay bridge ?
the financial equivalent of the sand used by those armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leverage ##d buy - outs associated with them .
builders get away with using sand and fin ##an ##cier ##s junk when society decides it ' s okay , necessary even , to look the other way .
and by the early 1980s u . s . capitalist ##s had ample reason to welcome junk bonds , to look the other way .
by that time they found extremely low profit rates from non - financial corporate investment .
in theory , the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same .
but of course the market could decide that the firm ' s capital stock - - its assets - - means nothing if the firm is not producing profits .
but here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet , and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way .
the profit rate is still low and the q ratio was only 65 % in 1987 and 68 . 9 % in 1988 .
result : a landscape littered with lemon ##s , huge debt burden ##s crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate america .
the mounting risks did not go uno ##bs ##erved , even in the mid - 1980s .
but this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found .
all along they have been noting the tremor ##s and pointing out the underlying realities .
profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher , and now we have an extremely high - interest burden relative to cash flow .
the consequences of building empires with sand are showing up .
what is the consequence of a high - interest burden , high default rates and continued low profit ##ability ?
corporations need liquid ##ity , in the form of borrowed funds .
the consequence can be inflation , brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the def ##lation ##ary shock of a sudden crash .
attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort : an assault on wages .
the e ##gal ##itarian ##ism of modern america represents the essential achievement of the class ##less society envisioned by marx . ' '
mr . fu ##ku ##yama might want to consult some american workers on the subject of class and e ##gal ##itarian ##ism .
these are long - term richter readings on american capitalism .

mr . cock ##burn is a columnist for the nation and la weekly .
japanese newspaper ni ##hon kei ##zai shi ##mb ##un reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground - cargo and air - cargo systems .
the action follows federal express corp . ' s acquisition of flying tiger line inc . in august .
many airlines are talking about cargo ventures , and there have been rumors about such a tie between ja ##l and european airlines .
in tokyo , a ja ##l spokesman said he could n ' t confirm or deny the latest japanese report .
but he said ja ##l is talking to lu ##ft ##han ##sa and air france about some sort of cargo venture .
in frankfurt , a lu ##ft ##han ##sa spokesman confirmed talks are under way , but declined to comment .
` ` nothing is defined or signed at this point , ' ' mr . daly said of the talks .
whatever accord the three carriers reach , he said , he is skeptical it would create a separate airline .
if the three companies pool their air - freight businesses , their cl ##out would be considerable .
according to figures from the international air transport association , they carried a combined 1 . 8 million tons of freight last year .
federal express and flying tiger , as separate companies , carried a combined 2 . 6 million tons .
air france and lu ##ft ##han ##sa last month concluded a far - reaching cooperation accord that includes air - freight activities .
they plan to increase cooperation in freight ground - handling and create a world - wide computer system to process cargo .
other airlines would have access to the system , they said , and negotiations with partners were already under way .
both european airlines operate extensive fleets of boeing 747 freighter ##s and 747 comb ##is , aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck .
ja ##l also has signaled it is looking for toe ##hold ##s in europe before the end of 1992 .
last month , the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from british airways so it could funnel its passengers from london to other european destinations .
british airways said it has n ' t received a proposal from ja ##l .
imperial cup has annual sales of approximately $ 75 million .
the big board said carpenter ##s quickly erected a new options floor to acc ##omo ##date 40 traders from the pacific exchange .
in addition , specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup capital for market - making in pacific exchange options traded on the exchanges .
the most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading .
the pacific exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues , including highly active hilton hotels corp . , which is listed on the big board .
investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that ex ##pire tomorrow .
but professionals said throughout the day that the shut ##down would n ' t be a cause for alarm even if it were to persist for several days .
the sec reassigned trading in the options , however , to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options .
while the exchange ' s e ##qui ##ties floor in san francisco remained open on a limited basis , orders were being routed and executed in los angeles .
workers could dial out , but they could n ' t receive telephone calls .
` ` if one city is down , the other can take over . ' '
meanwhile , the broker ##age firms in san francisco were trying to cope .
traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows , despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls .
also , most of the telecommunications equipment was out .
volume is down out of san francisco , but not out of the 11 outlying offices , ' ' mr . da ##ggs added .
su ##tro ' s oakland office executed orders through the sacramento office , which was n ' t affected by the quake .
so the kidd ##er broker ##s had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks .
the company dispatched as many as 200 people in the san francisco area to do the work , though most of the re ##rou ##ting was done by computer .
service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown san francisco , while just parts of oakland and san jose were knocked out .
but dale irvine , director of the emergency center , said service was being restored to outlying san francisco areas .
in chicago yesterday , options clearing confirmed that it guarantees the pacific exchange options .
` ` we are seeing such exercises today , in fact .
international business machines corp . said its board approved the purchase of $ 1 billion of its common shares , a move that should help support its battered stock .
the announcement came after the market ' s close .
the move by ibm was n ' t exactly a surprise .
in addition , despite ibm ' s well - publicized recent problems , the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash .
as of the end of the second quarter , it had $ 4 . 47 billion of cash and market ##able securities on hand .
as a result , some securities analysts had predicted in recent days that ibm would author ##ize additional purchases .
` ` we view it as a good long - term investment , ' ' the spokesman said .
in the short term , the move is likely to have little effect .
at yesterday ' s closing price , $ 1 billion would buy back about 10 million shares , or less than 2 % of the roughly 580 million outstanding .
in addition , as of sept . 30 , the company still had authorization to buy $ 36 ##8 million of stock under a prior rep ##ur ##chase program .
first , it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its main ##frame ##s , ibm ' s bread - and - butter business .
then it had a series of smaller g ##lit ##ches , including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important works ##tation ##s .
finally , ibm had to delay the introduction of some high - end disk drives , which account for 10 % of its $ 60 billion of annual revenue .
none of the problems is necessarily fatal , and they are n ' t all necessarily even related .
there are also other factors at work that are outside ibm ' s control , such as currency exchange rates .
without that problem , ibm might have matched last year ' s earnings of $ 5 . 81 billion , or $ 9 . 80 a share .
still , investors will take some convincing before they get back into ibm ' s stock in a big way .
on wall street yesterday , northern california ' s killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck .
` ` wall street thinks of everything in terms of money , ' ' says tom gallagher , a senior op ##pen ##heimer & co . trader .
however , he added , such event - driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information .
before this bull ##ish theory surfaced , some insurance stocks initially fell , indicating that investors thought the quake might cost ins ##urer ##s a lot of money .
flu ##or corp . , a construction engineering firm , gained 75 cents to $ 33 . 375 .
but home - building stocks were a mixed bag .
other gain ##ers were companies with one or more und ##ama ##ged california ref ##iner ##ies .
wells fargo & co . fell 50 cents to $ 81 . 50 , and bank ##ame ##rica corp . fell 50 cents to $ 31 . 875 .
` ` property values did n ' t go up in california yesterday , ' ' says one money manager .
pacific gas & electric co . fell 37 . 5 cents to $ 19 . 625 .
one of its power generators was damaged , though the company said there wo n ' t be any financial impact .
pacific tel ##esis group lost 62 . 5 cents to $ 44 . 625 .
a computer failure delayed its earnings announcement , and some investors think it might have extra costs to repair damaged telephone lines .
heavy construction , property - casualty insurance and forest products were among the best performing industry groups in the dow jones equity market index yesterday .
friday ' s stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here .
timothy vincent , pet ##co chief executive officer , confirmed that pet ##co was withdrawing from the clearing business .
he added that pet ##co remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market ' s rapid plunge friday and monday ' s rebound .
a cb ##oe spoke ##sw ##oman declined comment on pet ##co .
the unprecedented transfer of accounts under ##sco ##red the options industry ' s desire not to have its credibility tar ##nished by potentially widespread trading default ##s on monday .
most also were relatively under ##cap ##ital ##ized compared with the size of most wall street securities firms .
betty lombard ##i is a mild - manner ##ed home ##maker and grandmother in rural hunter ##don county , n . j .
but put her behind a shopping cart and she turns ruthless .
if col ##gate tooth ##pas ##te offers a tempting money - saving coup ##on , she ' ll cross crest off her shopping list without a second thought .
some weeks when her supermarket runs a double - coup ##on promotion , she boasts that she shave ##s $ 22 off her bill .
money is n ' t the only thing that makes her dump once favorite brands .
` ` i always thought pepper ##idge farm was ta ##sty and high quality , ' ' mrs . lombard ##i says .
` ` but i do n ' t want any of that oil for my grand ##ki ##ds . ' '
clearly , people like mrs . lombard ##i are giving market ##ers fits .
while brand loyalty is far from dead , marketing experts say it has eroded during the 1980s .
` ` without some real product improvements , it ' s going to be difficult to win that loyalty back . ' '
more than half the users of 17 of the 25 products included in the survey said they ' re brand switch ##ers .
overall , 12 % of consumers are n ' t brand loyal for any of the 25 product categories .
about 47 % are loyal for one to five of the products .
only 2 % are brand loyal in 16 to 20 of the categories , and no one is loyal for more than 20 types of products .
only for cigarettes , mayo ##nna ##ise and tooth ##pas ##te did more than 60 % of users say they typically stick with the same brand .
people tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors , such as cigarettes and ke ##tch ##up .
he simply ca n ' t stomach the taste of heinz , she says .
the 31 - year - old home ##maker adds , ` ` the only other thing i ' m really loyal to is my virginia slim ##s cigarettes .
coke and pepsi are all the same to me , and i usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale . ' '
brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes , perfume and beer .
loyalty la ##gs most for ut ##ili ##tarian products like trash bags and batteries .
only 23 % of trash - bag users in the journal survey usually buy the same brand , and just 29 % of battery buyers stick to one brand .
underwear scored a mid ##dling 36 % in brand loyalty , but consumer researchers say that ' s actually quite high for such a mundane product .
` ` the high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women . ' '
he believes there ' s opportunity for a smart gasoline market ##er to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty .
what loyalty there is to gas brands , he believes , is a matter of stopping at the most convenient ##ly located service stations .
brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the journal survey .
higher - income people also tend to be more brand loyal these days , the journal survey and other research studies indicate .
an established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality , if not always the best value for the money .
` ` they ' re buying whatever ' s cheaper . ' '
the biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game : how those hot ##ly pursued but highly unpredictable baby boom ##ers will behave as they move into middle age .
they grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less allegiance so far .
but now that they ' re settling down and raising families , might they also show more stability in their brand choices ?
mr . kim of j . walter thompson does n ' t think so .
he believes baby boom ##ers will continue to be selective in their brand loyal ##ties .
while not as brand loyal as in the past , consumers today do n ' t buy products cap ##ric ##iously , either .
rather , they tend to have a set of two or three favorites .
sometimes , they ' ll choose rag ##u spaghetti sauce ; other times , it will be pre ##go .
ad ##vert ##iser ##s attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands .
if a more absorb ##ent pam ##pers hits the market , you can be sure a new and improved hug ##gies wo n ' t be far behind .
but given such strong brand di ##sl ##oya ##lty , some market ##ers are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising .
but most companies are too afraid to take that chance .
consider , for example , what happened to maxwell house coffee .
the kraft general foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business .
but since returning to advertising , maxwell house has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with arch ##ri ##val f ##ol ##gers .
` ` even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee , we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it . ' '
` ` the best odds are with your core franchise .
our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week , and we ' d like to increase that . ' '
so campbell is talking to its ` ` brand enthusiasts , ' ' probing their psychological attachment to its soup .
in one consumer focus group , a fan declared that , ` ` campbell ' s soup is like getting a hug from a friend . ' '
that helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising slogan : ` ` a warm hug from campbell ' s . ' '
ins ##urer ##s face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week ' s california earthquake .
reflecting that logic , insurance - company stocks posted strong gains .
ae ##t ##na and other ins ##urer ##s are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage .
most ins ##urer ##s already have mobilized their ` ` catastrophe ' ' teams to begin processing claims from their policy ##holders in northern california .
about 25 adjust ##ers were dispatched yesterday afternoon , along with laptop computers , cellular phones and blank checks .
ins ##urer ##s will be advertising 800 numbers - - probably on the radio - - that policy ##holders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims .
state farm , based in bloomington , ind . , is also the largest writer of personal - property earthquake insurance in california .
state farm said about 25 % of its policy ##holders in california have also purchased earthquake insurance .
they expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two .
roads and bridges in the bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage .
highways , such as the section of interstate 880 that collapsed in oakland , generally do n ' t have insurance coverage .
earthquake - related claims are n ' t expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole .
indeed , the earthquake could contribute to a turn ##around in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways .
for example , ins ##urer ##s may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophe ##s by increasing the amount of reins ##urance they buy .
reins ##urance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves .
his firm , along with some others , issued new buy recommendations on ins ##urer stocks yesterday .
still , a few individual companies , most likely smaller ones , could be devastated .
he suspects some ins ##urer ##s who had purchased reins ##urance to limit their exposure to catastrophe ##s will discover that reins ##urance was used up by hurricane hugo .
british , west german , scandinavian and other overseas ins ##urer ##s are bracing for big claims from the san francisco earthquake disaster .
jack byrne , chairman of fire ##man ' s fund , said this disaster will test the catastrophe reins ##urance market , causing these rates to so ##ar .
the maker of computer works ##tation ##s said a surge of government orders contributed to the increase .
revenue rose 95 % to $ 86 . 4 million from $ 44 . 3 million the year earlier .
in national over - the - counter trading , the company closed yesterday at $ 23 . 25 a share , down 25 cents .
the company said it also is making progress in negotiating the buy - out of its design division by management .
hunter wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous waste ##s in salt domes .
besides creating joint manufacturing ventures , the accord is expected to give gm about a 15 % stake that eventually would rise to about 30 % .
jaguar figures a friendly alliance with gm will fen ##d off un ##we ##lco ##me advances from ford motor co .
but ford , jaguar ' s biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to 10 . 4 % this week , is pressing harder for talks with sir john .
` ` we ' re getting to the point where we are going to have to meet ' ' with him , one ford official said yesterday .
ford probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon , he added .
ford has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later .
` ` i ' m not ob ##liga ##ted to sit down and talk to anybody , ' ' the jaguar chairman asserted yesterday .
he did n ' t rule out negotiations with ford , however .
sir john noted that gm , a longtime jaguar supplier , agrees ` ` we should remain an independent company . ' '
jaguar shares stood at 405 pen ##ce before ford ' s initial announcement , but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up .
the stock traded late yesterday on london ' s stock exchange at 67 ##3 pen ##ce , up 19 pen ##ce .
developing an executive - model range would mark a major departure for britain ' s leading luxury - car maker .
a typical british executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car .
gm ' s help would ` ` make it possible - lc ##b - for jaguar - rc ##b - to build a wider range of cars . ' '
an executive model would significantly boost jaguar ' s yearly output of 50 , 000 cars .
a pact with gm may emerge in as little as two weeks , according to sources close to the talks .
the deal would require approval by a majority of jaguar shareholders .
` ` we have to make it attractive enough that - lc ##b - holders - rc ##b - would accept it , ' ' sir john said .
that may be difficult , the jaguar chairman acknowledged , ` ` when you have somebody else breathing down your neck .
ford ca n ' t make a full - fledged bid for jaguar until u . k . government restrictions ex ##pire .
the anti - takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15 % of jaguar shares without permission until dec . 31 , 1990 .
but with its 10 . 4 % stake , ford can con ##ven ##e a special jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely .
otherwise , jaguar may have to tolerate the two u . s . auto giants each owning a 15 % stake for more than a year .
` ` it would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective , ' ' sir john said .
` ` it has never been done before , but there ' s always a first .
for the third quarter , total operating revenue grew 2 . 6 % to $ 3 . 55 billion from $ 3 . 46 billion .
total operating expenses increased 3 . 5 % to $ 2 . 78 billion from $ 2 . 69 billion .
overall access minutes of use increased 10 . 3 % and toll messages jumped 5 . 2 % .
bells ##outh chairman and chief executive officer john l . cl ##end ##eni ##n said three factors accounted for the drop in third - quarter earnings .
the company previously said that the recent acquisition of mobile communications corp . of america would dil ##ute 1989 earnings by about 3 % .
in addition , earnings were reduced by rate reductions in florida , kentucky , alabama , tennessee and louisiana .
for the third quarter , revenue increased 1 . 9 % to $ 2 . 55 billion from $ 2 . 51 billion .
local service revenue increased 3 . 5 % and directory and un ##re ##gul ##ated business revenue jumped 9 . 5 % .
but network access revenue dropped 4 % and toll revenue dropped 1 . 4 % .
a - reflects 2 - for - 1 stock split effective dec . 30 , 1988 .
b - reflects extraordinary loss of five cents a share for early debt retirement .
c - reflects extraordinary loss of five cents a share and extraordinary gain of 14 cents a share from cumulative effect of accounting change .
the two surveys , which asked different questions , were conducted using national random probability samples .
the poll conducted by peter d . hart research associates interviewed 2 , 06 ##4 adults age 18 and older from june 15 to june 30 , 1989 .
the poll conducted by the rope ##r organization interviewed 2 , 00 ##2 adults age 18 and older from july 7 to july 15 , 1989 .
responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with u . s . census data .
the margin of error for subgroup ##s - - for example , married women with children at home - - would be larger .
in addition , in any survey , there is always the chance that other factors such as question word ##ing could introduce errors into the findings .
program traders were buying and selling at full steam monday , the first trading session after the stock market ' s 190 . 58 - point plunge friday .
they accounted for a he ##ft ##y 16 % of new york stock exchange volume monday , the fourth busiest session ever .
on friday , 13 % of volume was in computer - guided program trades .
in august , by contrast , program trading averaged 10 . 3 % of daily big board turnover .
but as the out ##cr ##y faded by the spring of 1988 , they resumed .
some observers thought that after friday ' s sharp drop , the firms would rein in their program traders to avoid st ##oki ##ng more controversy .
but the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort .
one reason , they said , was that the official reports on the 1987 crash ex ##one ##rated program trading as a cause .
stock - index ar ##bit ##rage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerate ##s market moves , if not actually causing them .
in it , traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock - index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price disc ##re ##pan ##cies .
the big board ' s disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual .
though it collects such data daily , its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends .
the september figures are due to be released this week .
the big board declined to name the wall street firms involved in the activity friday and monday , or the type of strategies used .
though broker ##age officials defended their use of program trading , one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record .
futures trading resumed a half - hour later , but the session ended shortly thereafter , leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs , traders said .
by monday morning , they said , stock - index ar ##bit ##rage sell programs helped re - establish the link between stocks and futures .
but stunning vol ##ati ##lity was produced in the process .
at about 10 : 10 a . m . ed ##t , the market abruptly turned upward on stock - index ar ##bit ##rage buy programs .
by day ' s end , the dow industrial ##s had rebound ##ed 88 . 12 points , or nearly half of friday ' s drop .
the divide ##nd is pay ##able dec . 15 to stock of record nov . 15 .
the company earned $ 18 . 7 million , or 95 cents a share , a year earlier .
for the nine months , valley national posted a net loss of $ 136 . 4 million , or $ 6 . 90 a share .
it had profit of $ 48 . 6 million , or $ 2 . 46 a share , in the 1988 period .
valley national had been paying a quarterly divide ##nd of 36 cents a share .
the addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of $ 199 . 7 million that was announced in june .
the key will be whether arizona real estate turns around or at least stabilize ##s , he said .
valley national closed yesterday at $ 24 . 25 a share , down $ 1 , in national over - the - counter trading .
two years of cod ##dling , down the drain .
that ' s the way a lot of broker ##s feel today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock - market crash .
and until last friday , it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off .
` ` some of those folks were coming back , ' ' says leslie quick jr . , chairman , of discount broker ##s quick & reilly group inc .
` ` we had heard from people who had n ' t been active ' ' for a long time .
then came the frightening 190 - point plunge in the dow jones industrial average and a new wave of stock - market vol ##ati ##lity .
all of a sudden , it was back to square one .
` ` i think it will shake confidence one more time , and a lot of this business is based on client confidence . ' '
broker ##s around the country say the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie .
customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post - crash 1987 .
mr . mason says he ' s convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks , even though they believe the deck is stacked against them .
but ` ` these wide swings scare them to death . ' '
true , the amount of money investors are willing to en ##trust to their broker ##s has been growing lately .
the broker ##s ' hope has been that they could soon coa ##x investors into shifting some of their ho ##ard into the stock market .
and before last friday , they were actually making modest progress .
in 1987 , an average 19 . 7 % of big board volume was retail business , with the monthly level never more than 21 . 4 % .
the retail participation dropped to an average 18 . 2 % in 1988 , and shri ##vel ##ed to barely 14 % some months during the year .
but there did seem to be a retail activity pickup .
but ` ` friday did n ' t help things , ' ' says mr . sc ##hae ##fer .
investors will develop ` ` thicker skins , ' ' and their confidence will return , he says .
meanwhile , pain ##ew ##eb ##ber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving wall street their money .
` ` the equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there ' s a se ##mb ##lance of confidence . ' '
it could be a long wait , say some industry observers .
` ` then there ' ll be another swing .
given enough of these , this will drive everyone out except the most hardy , ' ' he adds .
the long - term outlook for the retail broker ##age business is ` ` miserable , ' ' mr . ross declares .

as part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the securities and exchange commission , a receiver was also appointed for the three venture - capital firms .

` ` some companies were del ##in ##quent in filing ##s and other actions , all of which cost money , ' ' mr . holmes said .

senate republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital - gains tax for individuals and corporations .
at the same time , a small group of senate democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon .
he added that he expects to talk to the democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal .
for individuals , the pack ##wood plan would exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year .
the exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 % .
the exclusion would apply to assets sold after oct . 1 , 1989 .
as an alternative , he said , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
that rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years .
current ira ##s could be rolled over into the new ira ##s but would be subject to tax .
newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held .
an extra exclusion would be given to long - held stock in small and medium - size corporations just starting up .
no one in the senate is considering the capital - gains plan passed by the house .
that plan would provide a 30 % exclusion to assets sold over a 2 1 \ / 2 - year period ending dec . 31 , 1991 .
after then , the house measure would boost the tax rate to 28 % and exclude from tax the gain at ##tri ##bu ##table to inflation .
senators are focusing on making a capital - gains differential permanent .

but this quake was n ' t the big one , the replay of 1906 that has been feared for so many years .
the economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two , although some transportation problems may last weeks or months .
also , the region ' s insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage .
of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned silicon valley into the nation ' s capital of high technology .
when the tremor ##s struck , the region ' s largely unseen high - tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air .
the battery packs have enough power for only three hours , but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel .
of some 160 switches in pacific bell ' s network , only four went down .
one of those was in hollis ##ter , cal ##if . , near the earthquake ' s epic ##enter .
that ' s because the widely used fiber - optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points .
the slack absorb ##s the pulling strain generated by an earthquake .
nevertheless , phone service was sporadic ; many computer terminals remained dark , and by late yesterday a third of san francisco remained without power .
business in the nation ' s fourth - largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed ; an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home .
the economic di ##sl ##ocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself , as virtually all businesses shut down .
in high - tech , the bay area accounts for 15 % to 20 % of the u . s . computer - related industry .
` ` obviously , things are going to have to go on hold for many companies . ' '
the damage to the bay area ' s roadway ##s could cause significant economic hardship .
california state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n ' t expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the bay area .
all major roadway ##s except interstate 880 , known as the ni ##mit ##z freeway , and the bay bridge were open by 1 p . m . yesterday .
officials expect difficulty routing traffic through downtown san francisco .
the earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack , making them imp ##ass ##ible .
other roads were ob ##st ##ru ##cted by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines , an emergency relief spokesman says .
san francisco mayor art ag ##nos estimated the damage to his city alone at $ 2 billion .
but many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short - lived .
it is possible , of course , that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n ' t be reached , particularly in areas nearest the epic ##enter .
ten of the plant ' s workers were injured when the quake hit about a half - hour into the afternoon shift ; seven were hospitalized .
metal racks on the plant floor fell over , and water main ##s ru ##pt ##ured , a spoke ##sw ##oman says .
most banks were closed but were expected to re ##open today with few problems anticipated .
at the federal reserve bank of san francisco , vice president robert fi ##enberg says operations were ` ` steaming along as usual ' ' yesterday afternoon .
` when the quake hit , we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up , ' ' he says .
` ` the volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual , ' ' he says .
a disaster - con ##ting ##ency plan in which the los angeles fed would come to san francisco ' s aid was n ' t needed , he adds .
most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion .
the telephone network simply could n ' t handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time .
the volume resulted in dial - tone delays that were as short as 15 seconds and as long as five minutes .
mr . band ##ler puts traffic volume at 10 to 50 times normal .
the companies block traffic much as highway on - ramps are blocked when traffic backs up .
pacific tel ##esis says its pacific bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally .
it may also lead to new safeguard ##s in major construction projects such as double - deck highways .
the construction industry is sure to feel increased demand .
` ` there will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state , federal and local employment , ' ' ms . mace says .
wall street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies .
shares of lone star industries inc . , a cement maker , rose sharply in anticipation of stepped - up demand .
but any increase is n ' t likely to be any kind of a surge .
it ' s something likely to be spread out over a long period of time .
there will be a lot of repair work that wo n ' t require the quantities of cement or concrete that new construct ##on would . ' '
lone star ' s san francisco facilities were n ' t damaged in the quake .
the earthquake is likely to reduce g ##np ne ##gli ##gi ##bly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins .
the first effects are , of course , negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending .
many of the lost tourism dollars wo n ' t be recovered ; many trips delayed never take place .
subsequently , however , the ill effects are likely to be offset , at least in economic terms , as construction activity begins .
because of the way the government keeps its books , the damage to the bay bridge , however costly , wo n ' t be counted as a minus .
the money spent on repairs will be counted as a plus .
` ` you certainly can say it ' s going to be extremely severe .
we really are talking about shutting down a major american city for a number of days , maybe for a few weeks . ' '
mr . goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $ 1 billion and could reach $ 4 billion .
he caution ##s that early damage estimates are often low ; the damage totals in hurricane hugo increased ten ##fold as more information was received .
the earthquake damage , of course , would have been far greater if the epic ##enter had been in downtown san francisco .
a direct hit on a major city , mr . goldberg figures , would cause $ 20 billion to $ 40 billion of damage .
fire ##man ' s fund ins ##ures 37 , 300 homes and auto ##s and 35 , 000 businesses in the bay area .
but many california ##ns may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property .
the independent insurance agents of america says fewer than one of every five california home ##own ##ers has earthquake insurance .
a somewhat higher percentage of people living in the bay area have bought the additional insurance protection , but the great majority are n ' t covered .
earthquake insurance typically runs $ 200 or more a year for a small house .
whatever the long - term economic effect , the scene from the helicopter above oakland is one of tragedy .
ga ##rgan ##tua ##n sections of a double - decker freeway have been heaved about like plastic building blocks .
atop them sit cars and trucks abandoned in a terrifying scramble to safety the day before .
in areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie cars that police say have been flattened into foot - thick slabs .
on the periphery , rescue workers seem , from the air , to move in slow motion .
they peck away at the 1 1 \ / 2 - mile section of rubble , searching for more of the 250 people thought to have died here .
about 20 other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake .
on ##lo ##oke ##rs say three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fire ##ball shortly after the quake struck .
efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water main ##s were severed as well .
from the air , ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high - pressure no ##zzle ##s trained on the site .
in the marina district , residents spent yesterday assessing damage , cleaning up and trying to find friends and neighbors .
evelyn bo ##cco ##ne , 85 years old , has lived in the district most of her life .
` ` now , we realize what our mothers must have gone through , ' ' she says .
` ` we always heard about the earthquake , but as children we did n ' t always listen .

resolution funding corp . plans to sell $ 4 . 5 billion of 30 - year bonds wednesday in the agency ' s first sale of securities .
the new bonds will be dated oct . 30 and mature oct . 15 , 2019 .
congress authorized $ 50 billion to be borrowed to pay for the th ##rift bail ##out .
of that amount , $ 20 billion has already been borrowed by the treasury department .
unless otherwise specified in a particular offer , the bonds wo n ' t be subject to redemption prior to maturity .
interest payments on the bonds will be pay ##able semi ##ann ##ually .
the bonds are subject to federal taxation in the u . s . , including income taxes .
called patients in the know , the program features fact sheets designed to be easy to understand .
the sheets tell how the medicine works , describe how to use it and list its possible side effects .
they are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed and include space for the doctor to write special instructions .
in addition , sea ##rle will give ph ##arm ##ac ##ists bro ##chu ##res on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores .
consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients .
dr . te ##ich said sea ##rle is ` ` the only company i know that voluntarily ' ' will make consumer information available .
bond prices ram ##bled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply .
early yesterday , bonds rose as investors rushed to buy treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plum ##met in the aftermath of the massive california earthquake .
for example , some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies , which face massive damage claims , would get hit hard .
but when the dow jones industrial average rose instead , bonds drifted lower .
interest rates barely budge ##d from tuesday ' s levels .
most junk bonds , which have been battered in recent weeks , continued a slow rec ##up ##eration and ended unchanged to slightly higher .
but some so - called high - quality junk issues fell as some mutual funds sold their most liquid issues to raise cash .
r ##j ##r holdings capital corp . ' s 14 . 7 % bonds due 2009 fell one point .
other r ##j ##r issues fell between 1 \ / 2 point and 1 1 \ / 2 point .
continental , a unit of texas air corp . , slashed the size of its note offering from $ 150 million to $ 71 million .
in the multi ##par ##t offering , the company sold a portion of secured notes but she ##lved all the un ##se ##cured notes .
a continental spoke ##sw ##oman said the notes may be offered at a later date .
` ` this was not a do - or - die deal , ' ' she said .
` ` i think this is a market that required some level of security .
it did not make sense to offer un ##se ##cured paper in an un ##sett ##ling market . ' '
supply troubles were also on the minds of treasury investors yesterday , who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week .
` ` the market is concerned about its ability to under ##write all this debt at current levels . ' '
and resolution funding corp . said late yesterday that it will sell $ 4 . 5 billion of 30 - year bonds wednesday .
ref ##corp is the financing unit of resolution trust corp . , a new government agency created to rescue the nation ' s troubled th ##rift ##s .
its securities have been dubbed ` ` bail ##out bonds ' ' by traders .
in when - issued trading , the two - year treasury ##s had a yield of about 7 . 88 % .
in the municipal market , all eyes were on california debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ram ##ification ##s of tuesday ' s earthquake .
but traders said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of california state and local municipal debt .
since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield , an extra premium for the earthquake risk , they were n ' t material ##ly affected .
he also expects the performance of municipal ##s to la ##g treasury ##s as california is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities .
investment - grade corporate bonds ended 1 \ / 4 point lower .
the continental junk bond offering , under ##written by dr ##ex ##el burnham lambert inc . , was the only new issue priced yesterday .
in the four - part offering , the $ 71 million of secured equipment certificates was priced to yield 13 . 75 % to 15 . 75 % .
chemical securities inc . is acting as agent for the seller .
but new york city general obligation bonds came under selling pressure .
traders said a steady stream of bonds was put up for sale yesterday , pushing yields for longer mat ##urities up 0 . 05 percentage point .
traders said investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city ' s finances and are nervous ahead of the nov . 7 election .
washington , d . c . , topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of $ 200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes .
in late trading , new jersey turnpike authority ' s 7 . 20 % issue of 2018 was off 1 \ / 4 point at 98 bid .
the yield was 7 . 35 % , up 0 . 01 percentage point .
there was no app ##re ##cia ##ble market impact from the california earthquake .
dealers said there was some concern that insurance companies might be forced to sell mortgage securities to help pay earthquake - related claims , but no selling materialized .
but their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans they purchase .
and because northern california home prices are so high , loans from the region often are too large to be included in freddie mac and fan ##nie mae pools .
meanwhile , government national mortgage association 9 % securities for november delivery ended at 97 29 \ / 32 , unchanged .
freddie mac 9 % securities were at 97 4 \ / 32 , down 1 \ / 32 .
in derivative markets , fan ##nie mae issued two $ 400 million real estate mortgage investment con ##du ##its backed by its 9 % securities .
british government bonds , or gil ##ts , ended moderately lower as e ##qui ##ties there recovered from tuesday ' s drop .
traders said today may be an anxious day for the market .
the chancellor sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic policy changes .
economists do n ' t expect any such changes in this year ' s address , given mr . lawson ' s apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently .
meanwhile , japanese government bonds retreated in quiet trading , st ##ym ##ied by the dollar ' s res ##ili ##ency .
japan ' s bell ##we ##ther 4 . 6 % bond due 1998 ended on broker ##s ' screens at 95 . 75 to yield 5 . 315 % .
in west germany , investors stayed on the side ##lines as the bond market searched for direction .
the government ' s 7 % issue due october 1999 fell 0 . 05 point to 99 . 90 to yield 7 . 01 % .
but while it was a move that stunned the east bloc , it hardly usher ##s in an era of reform - - at least anytime soon .
east germany , it is clear , is no poland , where the communist party now shares power with the democratic ##ally elected solidarity union .
nor is it a hungary , where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the communist nation into a multi ##par ##ty democracy .
still , any change in east germany has enormous implications , for both east and west .
mr . k ##ren ##z is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation ' s parliament con ##ven ##es later this week .
his grip on power un ##rave ##led this summer as thousands of his country ##men , dissatisfied by the harsh ##ness of his rule , fled to the west .
thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in east germany ' s largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers ' uprising in 1953 .
in washington , the bush administration took a characteristic ##ally cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change .
the official line was to offer warmer ties to mr . k ##ren ##z , provided he is willing to institute reforms .
but u . s . officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer .
because mr . k ##ren ##z has been very much in accord with the policies of hon ##eck ##er . ' '
indeed , mr . k ##ren ##z said on east german television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro - democracy groups .
he said , while dialogue is important , enough forums already exist ` ` in which different interests ' ' can express themselves .
the removal of mr . hon ##eck ##er was apparently the result of bitter in ##fighting within the top ranks of the communist party .
those allies included pol ##it ##buro members gu ##enter mit ##tag , who has long headed economic affairs , and joachim hermann , chief of information policy .
both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday .
clearly , the central figure in this process is ego ##n k ##ren ##z .
born in 1937 in a baltic sea town now part of poland , he was eight years old when world war ii ended .
like west german chancellor helmut ko ##hl , he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during germany ' s division .
moreover , both men have he ##wn to a similar hard - line philosophy .
he later defended the chinese government ' s response during a separate visit to west germany .
however , mr . k ##ren ##z also has a reputation for being politically sa ##v ##vy .
indeed , according to west german government sources , he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled mr . hon ##eck ##er .
in recent days , mr . k ##ren ##z has sought to project a kind ##er image .
according to a report widely circulating in east berlin , it was mr . k ##ren ##z who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in leipzig .
` ` he ' s not a reformer - - he wants to have the image of a reformer . ' '
west german government officials and western analysts are doubtful .
` ` he does n ' t sign ##ify what people want , so the unrest will go on , ' ' mr . old ##enburg predict ##s .
at the same time , the expectations of the east german people are great and will continue to grow .
says one west german official : ` ` what ' s necessary now is the process of democrat ##ization .
not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously . ' '
chancellor ko ##hl , meanwhile , has invited mr . k ##ren ##z to open discussions with bonn on a wide range of subjects .
adding to that speculation is mr . k ##ren ##z ' s reputation as a heavy drink ##er , who is said to also suffer from diabetes .
` ` this is a dynamic process and we ' re experiencing the first step , ' ' the bonn official adds .
the selection of mr . k ##ren ##z may also di ##sa ##pp ##oint moscow .
soviet leader mikhail go ##rba ##chev has pressed hard for a change in east germany ' s rigid stance .
if mr . k ##ren ##z sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the soviet union could int ##ens ##ify .
a force of younger pro - go ##rba ##chev members in the east german bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country .
unlike the other nations of the bloc , east germany is a creature of the cold war .
but it could ultimately lead to german reunification and the disappearance of east germany from the map .
the less - self - confident czechoslovak ##s and bulgarian ##s , in contrast , declared their intentions to reform , while doing nothing concrete about it .
the east german media soon began presenting mr . go ##rba ##chev ' s speeches only as sketch ##y sum ##mar ##ies , and giving space to his opponents .
by late 1988 , they were banning soviet publications .
the country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road .
mr . hon ##eck ##er spoke of ` ` generally valid objective laws of socialism ' ' and left no room for debate .
pol ##it ##buro member joachim herr ##man confessed to a ` ` grave concern ' ' over hungarian democracy .
some loyal voices , in and out of the east german communist party , saw the nation ' s unrest coming .
despite heavily sub ##si ##di ##zed consumer industries , east germans have for years watched the west pull farther out ahead .
in 1988 , for the first time , economic growth came to a dead stop .
gingerly , some economists began to blame central planning .
some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy , at least in the workplace .
by summer , an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before .
their proclaimed purpose is to clean ##se east germany of its stalin ##ist mu ##ck , not to merge with the west .
one of their pastor ##s has envisioned a ` ` new utopia ' ' of ` ` creative socialism . ' '
meanwhile , the man mr . k ##ren ##z replaces has left an ind ##eli ##ble mark on east german society .
finally , during his first and only state visit to bonn two years ago , he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought .
but ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his own comrade , mr . go ##rba ##chev .
mr . hon ##eck ##er ' s removal ` ` was bound to happen , ' ' says one aide to chancellor ko ##hl .
` ` it was only a matter of time . ' '
in its annual economic report for 1989 - 1990 , the commission also projected 1990 gross domestic product growth for the 12 ec members at 3 % .
ec inflation was seen at 4 . 8 % in 1989 , higher than 1988 ' s 3 . 6 % price rise .
however , inflation for 1990 was seen slowing to 4 . 5 % .
leading ec growth forecast ##s in 1989 was ireland , seen growing 5 % at constant prices .
inflation is expected to be highest in greece , where it is projected at 14 . 25 % , and portugal , at 13 % .
at the other end of the spectrum , west german inflation was forecast at 3 % in 1989 and 2 . 75 % in 1990 .

a chinese official harshly criticized plans to close a british naval base in downtown hong kong .
hong kong officials announced last week that the base will be relocated to a small island to allow downtown redevelopment .
but beijing wants to use the base for the people ' s liberation army after 1997 , when the territory returns to chinese sovereignty .
he added that concluding the deal requires approval by the governments of both countries , which have never had direct air links .

a grand jury here indicted norton co . ' s former director of advanced - ceramics research , charging him with interstate transportation of stolen property .
norton and general electric co . last month filed a lawsuit against the former research manager , chi ##en - min sung , charging him with stealing trade secrets .

there were no complaints from affiliates of cbs inc . and cable news network , a unit of turner broadcasting system inc .
but that was not the case at nbc news , which has been dogg ##ed with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories .
last summer , the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in china .
a spokesman for national broadcasting co . , a unit of general electric co . , said the network was ` ` looking into what happened . ' '
the stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday , including a special five - hour edition of ` ` today . ' '

pinnacle west capital corp . said it suspended indefinitely its common stock divide ##nd and reported a 91 % plunge in third - quarter net income .
the announcement , made after the close of trading , caught analysts by surprise .
the company closed at $ 12 a share , down 62 . 5 cents , in composite trading on the new york stock exchange .
a company spokesman said the decision to eliminate the divide ##nd resulted from a quarterly app ##rai ##sal and that circumstances had changed since the december announcement .

with airline deals in a tails ##pin , legendary wall street trader michael stein ##hardt could have trouble para ##chu ##ting out of usa ##ir group , traders say .
only a week ago , when airline buy - out fever was already winding down , mr . stein ##hardt was engaged in a duel with usa ##ir .
now , in the wake of ua ##l ' s troubles in financing its buy - out , the airline raiding game has been grounded .
at the current price , the usa ##ir holding represents 9 % of all the assets that mr . stein ##hardt manages .
traders say this all goes to show that even the smart ##est money manager can get infected with crowd passions .
in trying to raid usa ##ir , mr . stein ##hardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor , and ran into s ##na ##gs .
meanwhile , his big losses , for instance in 1987 ' s crash , generally have been trading losses .
analysts say usa ##ir stock might lose four or five points if the stein ##hardt stake was dumped all at once .
but usa ##ir might not want to help mr . stein ##hardt , he adds .
in 1987 , usa ##ir chairman edwin col ##od ##ny stone ##wall ##ed when trans world airlines chairman carl ic ##ah ##n threatened to take over the carrier .
mr . stein ##hardt also could take that route .
he con ##fers big trading commissions on wall street firms .
however , with airline stocks crater ##ing , he might not get a very good price for his shares , traders say .
such disclosure ##s of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company ' s managers , and to stir interest in the stock .
but of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as stein ##hardt partners to take over a company .
usa ##ir and mr . buffet ##t wo n ' t talk about mr . stein ##hardt at all .
by the second half of 1990 , usa ##ir stock could hit 60 , says he ##lane becker of shear ##son lehman hutton .
she thinks traders should buy the stock if it tumble ##s to 35 .
but meanwhile , usa ##ir is expected to show losses or lack ##lus ##ter profit for several quarters as it tries to digest piedmont airlines , which it acquired .
moreover , some investors think a recession or renewed air ##fare wars will pu ##mmel airline stocks in coming months .
however , mr . stein ##hardt says he ' s ` ` comfortable holding usa ##ir as an investment . ' '
mr . stein ##hardt adds that he bought usa ##ir stock earlier this year as ` ` part of a fundamental investment in the airline group . ' '
in 1989 , mr . stein ##hardt says he made money trading in texas air , am ##r and ua ##l .
overall , his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20 % , he adds .
does mr . stein ##hardt regret his inc ##urs ##ion into the takeover - threat game ?

that will mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for commodore and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turn ##around it had seemed to be engineering .
commodore said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced early next month .
in fact , commodore ' s fiscal fourth - quarter loss was $ 2 million narrower than commodore had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed .
the price can be expected to er ##ode further , because the loss estimate came after the market closed .
commodore has assembled an experienced management team , it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign .
but those represent long - term strategies that probably wo n ' t succeed quickly , even if they turn out to be the right ones .
in the meantime , the strategies will increase expenses .
but sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months , even in west germany , which has been by far commodore ' s strongest market .
commodore has said it expects sales to rebound , but market researchers have said that sales of the low - end products may finally be trailing off .
